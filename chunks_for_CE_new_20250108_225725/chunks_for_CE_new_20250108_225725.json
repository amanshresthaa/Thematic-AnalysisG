    "transcript_chunk": "Good afternoon, everyone.\n***\nI'm Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens JMP.\n***\nIt's a pleasure to have Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs with me today.\n***\nRipple is one of the largest and most successful companies in the digital asset space.\n***\nAnd the goal here today is really, to help educate our institutional clients on Ripple's business model, the opportunity going forward, and then also gain some perspective on, what's going on in the industry and where we're evolving to.\n***\nObviously, I think a lot of talk lot to talk about in there.\n***\nSo, Brad, first off, great to see you.\n***\nI know you're a busy man these days, and there's a lot going on.\n***\nBut, you know, we're about 1 month post election here.\n***\nYou can kinda feel the optimism building in the room, and and I think there's a lot to get into around that.\n***\nBut but, really, maybe, I think the best place to start is your journey, to Ripple in 2015.\n***\nYou know, you you came to Ripple well before, I think the company was a household name well before people really understood blockchain technology and that move moving into the mainstream.\n***\nSo I'd love to just get that perspective first, and I think we have a lot, to catch up on.\n***\nYeah.\n***\nI appreciate it.\n***\nWell, thanks for thanks for having me.\n***\nThere is a lot going on, and I agree with your earlier comment of, you know, it, very good and kinda post election world.\n***\nSo I I first was exposed to Bitcoin actually in 2012.\n***\nPeter Thiel and a guy named Orin Hoffman run an annual conference called Dialog.\n***\nI think it happens twice a year now, but, and there was a session on Bitcoin.\n***\nI'd never heard of it and, participated with some of my friends.\n***\nYou know, this Dialog is not really you're not really spoken at, but kind of small groups.\n***\nAnd I don't remember who the advocate was.\n***\nIt might have been Mickey Malka, but, talking about Bitcoin.\n***\nAnd at the time, I was doing some angel investing, and so I kind of treated it as, okay.\n***\nYou know, it might go to 0.\n***\nIt's something better.\n***\nI I, frankly, I always worried that the Achilles' heel of Bitcoin might be this kind of anti bank, anti government sentiment.\n***\nAnd, you know, it's just to me, it limited the market opportunity if you're gonna take a a that approach because I feel like governments aren't gonna go away, banks aren't gonna go away in my opinion.\n***\nSo years later, a recruiter actually called me and introduced me to Ripple.\n***\nAnd what resonated with me right out of the gates was this idea of how do we work with the legacy infrastructure, what we now would call TradFi.\n***\nAnd, you know, that included government and certainly banks, and it it resonated with me that Ripple is trying to work with the system rather than, create a fully new system.\n***\nThere's obviously, you know, arguments on both sides of that.\n***\nI can see those arguments.\n***\nBut, from the very earliest days, Ripple's kinda taken approach of we're going to be a bridge between decentralized finance and traditional finance and, bring products to market to help help bridge those both, frankly, culturally, technologically, etcetera.\n***\nSo that's that's how my journey began.\n***\nAs you pointed out, I joined in 2015, through, you know, a little luck, a little skill.\n***\nWe find ourselves in a really compelling place with a bunch of customers and, you know, scaling products.\n***\nSo we're pretty pleased about that.\n***\nSo talk a little bit about the the business journey of Ripple itself.",

    "transcript_chunk": "***\nCan you talk a little bit about the blockchain piece of it?\n***\nBecause I think, you know, I've worked in traditional finance for over 20 years.\n***\nYou know, cover traditional financial firms, but also cover digital asset firms.\n***\nAnd I think, you know, a lot of institutional clients who were educating on the blockchain technology, they're trying to understand, like, the application of it in into traditional finance and why is this the right structure for for payments as an example, or, you know, what what what is the value prop of a stablecoin itself versus just, you know, the the you whatever may be within payments or remittance or Yep.\n***\nOr any other use cases of of stablecoins?\n***\nWell, so, I mean, for me, there's 2 questions in there.\n***\nYou know, one is the second one is on stablecoins.\n***\nThe first one, you know, what you know, how is blockchain embedded there?\n***\nI mean, to me, the novelty of a blockchain is allowing 2 parties to transact who don't have they they don't have a relationship, but to do that with without trust, but with certainty.\n***\nSo today, that that doesn't really exist.\n***\nRight?\n***\nWhen you are transacting today, someone is passing the trust bar between.\n***\nSo, you know, if you use your Visa card, Visa is the trusted party between the mer you and the merchant don't have any trust.\n***\nVisa has trust on both sides, and so they are taking a premium, to pass that trust.\n***\nThere's a whole bunch of financial examples where the the settlement between two transactions, there's a a central counterparty that's extracting value to commute the trust between those two parties.\n***\nIf you can do that without the central counterparty, you're gonna increase speed.\n***\nYou're gonna decrease cost.\n***\nYou're improving efficiency and, you know, or by by removing a step, you're probably improving error rates.\n***\nAnd so what you're finding is, I think, there will be more and more examples of how people apply a blockchain to improve the efficiency of a transaction.\n***\nSo so you don't have to have a central counterparty.\n***\nIn the payments business, you know, sometimes you have multiple, hops along a journey when you're sending money cross border.\n***\nAnd, you know, each of those hops adds time, adds cost, adds complexity, adds risk of error.\n***\nAnd, you know, our view has, for a long time, really been, how is it that we have an Internet of information that allows any piece information to transmit instantly, interoperably across many networks, but you don't have the ability to do that money?\n***\nIn some ways, and I say this as a guy who was involved in the early days of the Internet, it is reminiscent of, you know, you had Prodigi, you had AOL, America Online, and you had CompuServe.\n***\nBut if you, Devin, wanted to send me an email from CompuServe to Prodigi, and I was on Prodigi, you that was not actually possible.\n***\nYou had to have an account as a closed network.\n***\nWell, along come technologies like HTTP and TCPIP, and in the email case, SMTP that allowed interoperability between the closed networks and thus the Internet of information.\n***\nWe really think about the the closed networks of payment networks.\n***\nSome of those are on a national scale.\n***\nRight?\n***\nYou have domestically closed networks.\n***\nBut look.\n***\nPayPal is effectively a closed network.\n***\nVenmo is a closed network.\n***\nVisa is a closed network.",

    "transcript_chunk": "***\nAnd the interoperability between these networks is actually what, you know, people are extracting lots of, tolls for to allow that to pass between them.\n***\nAnd that that's where the inefficiency comes.\n***\nSo from our point of view, the the Internet of information is being is is giving way to the Internet of value, the Internet of money, and allowing money to move the way information moves today.\n***\nAnd that's gonna be at a much lower cost, much faster, lower error rates.\n***\nAnd so, we we have been selling into the the infrastructure layer now for years.\n***\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, we're kind of our 3rd generation product, and, you know, doing 1,000,000,000 of dollars of transactions and then obviously selling custody and other solutions, and potentially other things beyond that in the coming years.\n***\nAnd there still needs to be trust in in Ripple as a business and as you're going out and and bring in new customers.\n***\nSo how talk about that journey and just the the building of trust and and the brand awareness because you're, in some ways, you're competing against a traditional financial system.\n***\nYou're also competing against other potential blockchain business models that that wanna do something similar.\n***\nYou guys have built a massive business already, and and to me, it still feels like we're very early days.\n***\nSo talk about the building trust and the education in the market and and where you think we we are in that process.\n***\nYeah.\n***\nI'll I'll start at the end of that one.\n***\nI I think that the most interesting part is trying to figure out where are we in this journey.\n***\nAnd I I'll use the Internet, of information as a comparison.\n***\nYou know, a lot of people think the Internet started in the nineties.\n***\nNetscape was born in 95.\n***\nBut, really, the the Internet really was born in the early seventies out of, you know, the the DARPA and then ARPANET or ARPANET, DARPANET, whatever.\n***\nAnd, you know, then you connect universities, and then you end up getting, a particular school in Illinois connected, and they launched the Mosaic browser.\n***\nAnd each step was about simplicity and simplifying the use of these networks.\n***\nWell, I think you\n***\nand I would probably agree using the crypto networks, blockchains, is not simple today.\n***\nThen it I mean, even for someone who's deep into it, sometimes I'm I\n***\nI find it frustrating.\n***\nAnd I I think we are still in the kind of almost DARPA net stage of blockchain where we haven't yet had the birth of Mosaic or the birth of Detscape that unlocks more and more simplicity.\n***\nAnd it's frankly one of the reasons why Ripple has focused at the enterprise level because we can, frankly, obfuscate a lot of that complexity of using blockchain such that our customers don't even have to see or touch that, but still have the benefit of improved speed, improved cost, improved error rates.\n***\nSo, I I think we're we're early in that journey.\n***\nI think there's gonna be, you know, a bunch of significant winners.\n***\nI mean, some people would say, well, you already have a bunch of big winners.\n***\nBitcoin's at 1.8 trillion.\n***\nETH is, you know, 400 to 500,000,000,000.\n***\nBut, you know, we really only gonna have the winners once you really have the scaled utility scaled use cases that are solving real problems for customers.\n***\nI think we probably all agree that right now, there's a lot of speculation in the market and some utility, some other pieces.\n***\nBut, you know, Ripple has always tried to focus on okay.\n***\nWe're solving problems for customers.\n***\nWe're not trying to lean into meme coins, for example.\n***\nYou know, you you can use the XRP Ledger as open source technology to do meme coins if you would choose to do so.",
