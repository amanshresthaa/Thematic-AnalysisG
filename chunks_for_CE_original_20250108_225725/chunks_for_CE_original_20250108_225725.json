    "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. I'm Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens JMP. It's a pleasure to have Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs with me today. Ripple is one of the largest and most successful companies in the digital asset space. And the goal here today is really, to help educate our institutional clients on Ripple's business model, the opportunity going forward, and then also gain some perspective on, what's going on in the industry and where we're evolving to.\n\nObviously, I think a lot of talk lot to talk about in there. So, Brad, first off, great to see you. I know you're a busy man these days, and there's a lot going on. But, you know, we're about 1 month post election here. You can kinda feel the optimism building in the room, and and I think there's a lot to get into around that.\n\nBut but, really, maybe, I think the best place to start is your journey, to Ripple in 2015. You know, you you came to Ripple well before, I think the company was a household name well before people really understood blockchain technology and that move moving into the mainstream. So I'd love to just get that perspective first, and I think we have a lot, to catch up on. Yeah. I appreciate it.\n\nWell, thanks for thanks for having me. There is a lot going on, and I agree with your earlier comment of, you know, it, very good and kinda post election world. So I I first was exposed to Bitcoin actually in 2012. Peter Thiel and a guy named Orin Hoffman run an annual conference called Dialog. I think it happens twice a year now, but, and there was a session on Bitcoin.\n\nI'd never heard of it and, participated with some of my friends. You know, this Dialog is not really you're not really spoken at, but kind of small groups. And I don't remember who the advocate was. It might have been Mickey Malka, but, talking about Bitcoin. And at the time, I was doing some angel investing, and so I kind of treated it as, okay.\n\nYou know, it might go to 0. It's something better. I I, frankly, I always worried that the Achilles' heel of Bitcoin might be this kind of anti bank, anti government sentiment. And, you know, it's just to me, it limited the market opportunity if you're gonna take a a that approach because I feel like governments aren't gonna go away, banks aren't gonna go away in my opinion. So years later, a recruiter actually called me and introduced me to Ripple.\n\nAnd what resonated with me right out of the gates was this idea of how do we work with the legacy infrastructure, what we now would call TradFi. And, you know, that included government and certainly banks, and it it resonated with me that Ripple is trying to work with the system rather than, create a fully new system. There's obviously, you know, arguments on both sides of that. I can see those arguments. But, from the very earliest days, Ripple's kinda taken approach of we're going to be a bridge between decentralized finance and traditional finance and, bring products to market to help help bridge those both, frankly, culturally, technologically, etcetera.\n\nSo that's that's how my journey began. As you pointed out, I joined in 2015, through, you know, a little luck, a little skill. We find ourselves in a really compelling place with a bunch of customers and, you know, scaling products. So we're pretty pleased about that. So talk a little bit about the the business journey of Ripple itself.\n\nSo, you know, Ripple payments to then custody, sounds like an imminent, stable coin. So just talk a little bit about the journey of an evolution of the company up until today. So, you know, when when I first joined Ripple, this is again back in 2015, we were kind of at this we were a small company, fewer than a 100 people, thinking about your different use cases around how do you leverage these blockchain technologies and to some degree, how do you use the XRP Ledger in particular to build, you know, use cases that are interesting. And there were 3 products at the company when I first joined or 3 experiments at the company when I joined. You know, one was around infrastructure payments where we're particularly on cross border infrastructure payments.\n\nThe second was around a project called Codius, which is a smart contract platform on the XRP Ledger. And then the third, was a something around identity management. And, you know, one of the first things I really decided is there's no chance we can do all 3 of these things, and let's pick 1. And this maybe was a kind of harking back to, my days at Yahoo and kind of you can't spread yourself too thin around, Yahoo to try to do anything. So we decided to focus on, cross border payments and selling into the enterprise and financial institutions.\n\nAnd, yeah, that journey has evolved when, you know, we started with kind of generation 1 product, I guess, generation 2. We're now kind of generation 3, but all kind of focused on that same point that the the the costs and the, delays and the the error rates around the kind of traditional cross border payments architecture are pretty flawed. There's a whole bunch of interesting companies doing stuff around the front end of that. Didn't realize I can get hearts out of that. That was kinda cool.\n\nBut there's a whole bunch of things around the front end of that, but not many companies are focused on the back end and the infrastructure side of that and really kind of building a better swift. Part of your question there was, you know, we started just doing payments, and what we realized is that in order to do it well, you needed to have robust infrastructure around custody. And, I guess, close to 18 months ago, we bought a company based in Switzerland called Medeco, which was really due to winning a lot of market share, at the tier one bank level of selling the the technology to banks, so they could safely and, you know, manage and manage and custody crypto, themselves. And as you said, we are getting close very, very close to launching, we call Ripple USD, a stablecoin. The the history of that really quickly is we have been using stablecoins in our payment flows for a a long time, years.\n\nAnd at one point, we found ourselves we were responsible for minting about 20% of all USDC. And we kinda started to ask ourselves, wait a minute. You know, is there a way that we should be a principal in this market? And for a whole bunch of reasons, we decided to jump in. We will launch very soon, under the auspices of the New York DFS trust license, which we are, very close to finalizing.\n\nCan you talk a little bit about the blockchain piece of it? Because I think, you know, I've worked in traditional finance for over 20 years. You know, cover traditional financial firms, but also cover digital asset firms. And I think, you know, a lot of institutional clients who were educating on the blockchain technology, they're trying to understand, like, the application of it in into traditional finance and why is this the right structure for for payments as an example, or, you know, what what what is the value prop of a stablecoin itself versus just, you know, the the you whatever may be within payments or remittance or Yep. Or any other use cases of of stablecoins?\n\nWell, so, I mean, for me, there's 2 questions in there. You know, one is the second one is on stablecoins. The first one, you know, what you know, how is blockchain embedded there? I mean, to me, the novelty of a blockchain is allowing 2 parties to transact who don't have they they don't have a relationship, but to do that with without trust, but with certainty. So today, that that doesn't really exist.\n\nRight? When you are transacting today, someone is passing the trust bar between. So, you know, if you use your Visa card, Visa is the trusted party between the mer you and the merchant don't have any trust. Visa has trust on both sides, and so they are taking a premium, to pass that trust. There's a whole bunch of financial examples where the the settlement between two transactions, there's a a central counterparty that's extracting value to commute the trust between those two parties.\n\nIf you can do that without the central counterparty, you're gonna increase speed. You're gonna decrease cost. You're improving efficiency and, you know, or by by removing a step, you're probably improving error rates. And so what you're finding is, I think, there will be more and more examples of how people apply a blockchain to improve the efficiency of a transaction. So so you don't have to have a central counterparty.\n\nIn the payments business, you know, sometimes you have multiple, hops along a journey when you're sending money cross border. And, you know, each of those hops adds time, adds cost, adds complexity, adds risk of error. And, you know, our view has, for a long time, really been, how is it that we have an Internet of information that allows any piece information to transmit instantly, interoperably across many networks, but you don't have the ability to do that money? In some ways, and I say this as a guy who was involved in the early days of the Internet, it is reminiscent of, you know, you had Prodigi, you had AOL, America Online, and you had CompuServe. But if you, Devin, wanted to send me an email from CompuServe to Prodigi, and I was on Prodigi, you that was not actually possible.\n\nYou had to have an account as a closed network. Well, along come technologies like HTTP and TCPIP, and in the email case, SMTP that allowed interoperability between the closed networks and thus the Internet of information. We really think about the the closed networks of payment networks. Some of those are on a national scale. Right?\n\nYou have domestically closed networks. But look. PayPal is effectively a closed network. Venmo is a closed network. Visa is a closed network.\n\nAnd the interoperability between these networks is actually what, you know, people are extracting lots of, tolls for to allow that to pass between them. And that that's where the inefficiency comes. So from our point of view, the the Internet of information is being is is giving way to the Internet of value, the Internet of money, and allowing money to move the way information moves today. And that's gonna be at a much lower cost, much faster, lower error rates. And so, we we have been selling into the the infrastructure layer now for years.\n\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, we're kind of our 3rd generation product, and, you know, doing 1,000,000,000 of dollars of transactions and then obviously selling custody and other solutions, and potentially other things beyond that in the coming years. And there still needs to be trust in in Ripple as a business and as you're going out and and bring in new customers. So how talk about that journey and just the the building of trust and and the brand awareness because you're, in some ways, you're competing against a traditional financial system. You're also competing against other potential blockchain business models that that wanna do something similar. You guys have built a massive business already, and and to me, it still feels like we're very early days.\n\nSo talk about the building trust and the education in the market and and where you think we we are in that process. Yeah. I'll I'll start at the end of that one. I I think that the most interesting part is trying to figure out where are we in this journey. And I I'll use the Internet, of information as a comparison.\n\nYou know, a lot of people think the Internet started in the nineties. Netscape was born in 95. But, really, the the Internet really was born in the early seventies out of, you know, the the DARPA and then ARPANET or ARPANET, DARPANET, whatever. And, you know, then you connect universities, and then you end up getting, a particular school in Illinois connected, and they launched the Mosaic browser. And each step was about simplicity and simplifying the use of these networks.\n\nWell, I think you and I would probably agree using the crypto networks, blockchains, is not simple today. Then it I mean, even for someone who's deep into it, sometimes I'm I I find it frustrating. And I I think we are still in the kind of almost DARPA net stage of blockchain where we haven't yet had the birth of Mosaic or the birth of Detscape that unlocks more and more simplicity. And it's frankly one of the reasons why Ripple has focused at the enterprise level because we can, frankly, obfuscate a lot of that complexity of using blockchain such that our customers don't even have to see or touch that, but still have the benefit of improved speed, improved cost, improved error rates. So, I I think we're we're early in that journey.\n\nI think there's gonna be, you know, a bunch of significant winners. I mean, some people would say, well, you already have a bunch of big winners. Bitcoin's at 1.8 trillion. ETH is, you know, 400 to 500,000,000,000. But, you know, we really only gonna have the winners once you really have the scaled utility scaled use cases that are solving real problems for customers.\n\nI think we probably all agree that right now, there's a lot of speculation in the market and some utility, some other pieces. But, you know, Ripple has always tried to focus on okay. We're solving problems for customers. We're not trying to lean into meme coins, for example. You know, you you can use the XRP Ledger as open source technology to do meme coins if you would choose to do so.\n\nAnd, frankly, there are examples of that happening on the XRP Ledger, right, because it's open source technology. Ripple and, like, how do we build trust is how do we make sure that, you know, our customers understand, you know, where where the kind of products we're bringing to market and that they work well, and they're adding value. And, you know, I I feel very good. It it's been a long journey. In in some ways, ironically, maybe the the SEC lawsuit against Ripple added trust to some degree.\n\nYou know? Because we prevailed well, because we fought the fight and, you know, prevailed on the kind of the key points that mattered, I think a lot of people, it it built trust, as well. And so I I do feel good about, you know, how ripple has emerged from some of this, but I I also would say to my earlier point, I think we're still in the early days. And, the journey ahead, I'm I'm very excited about. I wanna come back on the stable coins.\n\nYou talked for a moment about kind of the the value of of having your own stable coin. But can can you maybe just expand a little bit on that and and the structure of what the stablecoin at Ripple is gonna look like relative to maybe some others in the market? And then I think questions around just how that works with XRP, you know, how's complimentary and and actually drives value to the to the, XRP Ledger. I think that would be great to understand that better. Sure.\n\nSo, you know, as I'm sure many people who, you know, follow you are well aware, and I know you you know this pretty well, you know, the the the stablecoin market today globally is about $200,000,000,000. About 70% of that is Tether or USDT. Probably another, you know, 20% of that is USDC, which is Circle's kind of solution in the marketplace. And then there's a a longer tail after that of, you know, smaller players. You know, Tether is, you know, by I'm pro Tether and an advocate.\n\nThe US government, I think, is less so. That may change also, but, you know, Tether has intentionally set up outside the United States, outside of kind of the the the long arm of the the US, regulator. And, you know, I think that gives some major institutions pause about, you know, interest in working with them. And our view has been there's an opportunity for a a trusted brand like Ripple, who has a lot of experience with institutions, a lot of experience with payment flows, to bring a a product to market that is truly the the the the most trusted, you know, that we will be the first to come out under, with a New York trust license. You know, we will be doing quarterly attest excuse me, monthly attestations.\n\nAnd, you know, I I think we're we do have our own balance sheet that, you know, in a if problems were to exist, we we were in a position to actually help solve those. So, now how will it coexist with XRP? You know, I well, first of all, on the any liquidity on the XRP Ledger is a good thing. It's good for the whole XRP ecosystem. And the more liquidity on there, including the stablecoins, it it reduces friction and the ability to do things, particularly in the DeFi world.\n\nThere's some native technologies embedded in the XRP Ledger, a decentralized exchange, DEX, a AMM automated market maker, and embedding a stablecoin, a robust stablecoin, a trusted stablecoin like Ripple USD, we think will actually help that. I don't think it competes with XRP as a different solution because, really, we think about that as the bridge currency. Right? So it it rl USD, Ripple USD is a dollar. The bridge currency is going in and out of other currencies and having the most liquid, most efficient bridge currency between between various currencies around the world, we think, is a needed solution, in scaling global commerce.\n\nYeah. And in terms of the customers, you you touched on a little bit. But, you know, historically, b to b and banks, payer providers, merchants, institutions, Talk about how these different customer groups have used Ripple over time, how that's evolved. And then, I'm assuming Stablecoin opens you up probably even more b to c as well, you know, with more applications. So maybe just so we can kind of think about, that evolution and then also, you know, where we go from here with customers.\n\nWe our our focus from a customer point of view has always been b to b. I think it'll remain b to b. You know, while a stablecoin can be used by consumers in the very nature is once it exists on your various exchanges, anybody can access it and use it however they'd like. Our focus will be in serving institutional clients, serving financial institutions. You know, over time, we may serve, you know, corporates in some some regard, but our focus remains very much, on b to b, kind of on the infrastructure layer, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.\n\nMhmm. Well, in terms of the between payment solutions or or custody solutions, are there different customers using the firm for, you know, a single point solution, or is it a is it a holistic relationship? Or where do you see either opportunity for it to go, or or where is it kinda naturally already been going? I mean, honestly, Deb, this is one of the things that gets me kinda most excited about, you know, the the the road ahead. You know, when we first started with the the payments, piece of cross border payments piece years ago, we were trying to mostly focus on tier 1 banks.\n\nWhat we found because that's where, really, the cross border payments activity at really big scales, existed. What we found for a whole bunch of reasons is, you know, the the classic innovator's dilemma, a reluctance to move quickly, then, of course, you have US regulatory stuff and the SEC lawsuit that only impacted that more. What we found, though, is all and we still have a number of customers in the tier one banks around payments, but we found a lot of demand, in, you know, payment providers, tier 2 banks, tier 3 banks, particularly outside the United States. The SEC sued us in December of 2020, and that evolved to where we are today where 95% of our customers are non US financial institutions. And, you know, I don't think I don't know that that unlocks yet.\n\nYou will see as, you know, the coming regulatory changes, I think, many people expect in the Trump administration, but, I I'm sort of excited about that unlock. Now part of your question, I think, is, you know, the the cross sell. Right? So, the custody customers that we we have today and where we continue to get a lot of traction is in the tier one banks. And so we feel like there's an opportunity, and we are seeing we don't require the cross sell.\n\nYou can, you know, choose to not work with us around custody and work with us around payments. And I think that will certainly remain the case. But we're seeing more and more that we, Ripple, can be the trusted first choice for solving a bank's or financial institution's, desires and needs around all things blockchain. So that's really where we wanna build the brand and build the the, excuse me, build the product suite. Mhmm.\n\nExcellent. Wanna pivot a little bit and talk about election, and, obviously, we can go a lot of directions here. But, you know, it it feels like this could be seminal moment for the space, and you guys have been already doing a lot of hard work and scale. But, new administration, people that are already coming together in place, there's rumors about SEC as well here. It seems like it could be favorable to the industry.\n\nSo what what are the if you if you had your way, you know, and and and, you know, things open up and maybe it felt like doors have been closed, like, what are the what are the the primary things you wanna do? And maybe I'll start there, but I I think, you know, there there's so much more to go into. But just some of the big, changes that you feel like you can come out of this and and position Ripple, for the future. And, again, there's a lot of uncertainty still, but, it does feel like there is a real tone change. Yeah.\n\nI mean, I think there has been a real tone change. It's just kind of there's still, steps to take. You know? I I think there does need to be legislation passed to provide some of the the clarity around, particularly, you know, securities laws where the SEC has been, I think I mean, abusive would be almost a generous word. You know, and the way they have approached it and kind of regulation through enforcement, it's it's not just been, you know, not constructive.\n\nI think, arguably, you know, you've had judges come out and say, it's been arbitrary and capricious. That's a quote. Another quote, and a federal judge said the SEC hasn't followed a faithful allegiance to law. That's a quote, in a particular case in a Utah federal court. You know, the SEC was sanctioned for misrepresentations to the court.\n\nSo, like, the this SEC has been, I think, again, generous to say unethical. It is changing for sure. And I think all of the Trump appointees that we have seen so far, you know, Scott Bessens at Treasury, I think, is gonna be an outstanding choice and is certainly excited about being pro innovation and how these technologies and how we can put America first and invest in these technologies rather than pushing them offshore. I mean, honestly, Devin, you you know, I get fired up about this stuff. But the irony of what was happening is we were saying we're we're gonna treat the US companies harsher and push activity offshore where it's less regulated and more risky instead of actually supporting US companies and helping and providing clear rules of the road.\n\nI think we will get some legislative clarity. There's a bill called fit 21 that passed the house, last summer. You know, probably I don't know if you'd be a derivative of that or something new, but I think in the first half of next year, we'll see, legislation that, you know, provides some clarity that will move more of the responsibility towards the CFTC. I as of today, I believe Paul Atkins has been appointed as SEC chair, and I think he's an outstanding choice. And I think, you know, he's very knowledgeable about this industry.\n\nAnd, you know, I I think it's a good thing for the the crypto industry to have this this change happening, and I think, it sets up for a very pro innovation, pro crypto, federal government. Yeah. It would seem We can go on more on that stuff. But Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd I I and there's I think there's more to get into. And I and I guess just the from a legislative perspective, this was really the first selection where this was a a front and center topic, and and clearly, it moved the needle. And it doesn't feel like we're going back in any like, the genie's out of the bottle here, and it can only go one direction. And so you have legislators in the house and senate that the majority are on record being, I think, positive on the industry. So in terms of just the ability to actually get something done in DC or closer to it even than I am, like, does it does it feel like post election, there's still real momentum, whether it's fit 21 or or something something else that, like, this will be, you know, a priority in this next administration.\n\nAnd and really, you know, it's great that there's in in the administration, but you really need the the legislators to to to to act. Yeah. I'm very optimistic, and I I think there's a bunch of data points to support that. And to get to your point, is it fit 21 or a derivative fit 21? I don't know.\n\nYou know? JD Vance as a senator, his office had written a proposed bill around market structure for crypto. It was never introduced, but I I think given that JD Vance's office had was drafted that, I think that that also might get a a seriously look, and I think that's a very positive, bill in providing the clarity the industry has asked for. So I'm very optimistic that that will happen. I think on the federal side, I mean, there's a lot of attention right now around something that also has really stymied and restrained constrained growth of this industry in the United States, which is, you you know, loosely called operation choke point 2.0, which has been the debanking of crypto and kinda the in the shadows, in the whispers.\n\nAnd that debanking was done in maybe continues. I don't know. You know, Ripple has had problems with that. You know, I personally got debanked. You know, it it it's really, in my view, super un American.\n\nYou know, these are law abiding. Ripple and, again, we now have that from a federal court court. The SEC certainly investigated us for years and read every email I ever wrote. So, you know, if there was bad acts that they would have I'm sure they would have happily gone after it. So, I think my guess is there'll be an executive order very early in the Trump administration, putting an end to this operation choke point 2.0.\n\nAnd I think, you know, it it sounds maybe kinda small, but just the ability for companies in our industry and for people in our industry to get bank accounts, particularly when Ripple, in particular, is trying to be that bridge between traditional finance and this decentralized finance world. You know, I think that's good for the industry. I think it's good for America. I think it's good for US job growth. I think it's good for US technical leadership.\n\nAnd so I think we we will see more putting US companies first, putting US technologies first in the Trump administration. And I think there really is a chance to make crypto great again in the United States. And, it's been, you know, a both a public and private war against crypto for for years here in United States, and so I'm excited to turn the page on that. Mhmm. Yeah.\n\nAnd it seems like there's an undercurrent also. You just mentioned it kind of the US technology, US blockchain. I think my sense is that's been helping, valuations of the industry, but, you know, maybe that's part of when you talk about XRP move. But, US blockchain potentially even now potentially moving back where where you get better treatment because you built the technology. I know it's a global technology, and it's a global company.\n\nBut, you know, is that is that relevant to you? And, you know, there's there's obviously proposals or at least talk about 0 taxes on crypto. How how big would that be? I mean, are there things like that that you feel like kind of maybe put Ripple as a business in even better position than than otherwise would be if it was, you know, US wasn't maybe getting favored, going forward? Because it seems like that that is maybe the position that this administration has taken.\n\nYeah. I mean, like, years ago, before Biden was elected, you know, what we were the the words I used to use is, like, I just wanna level playing field. Like, the US government shouldn't be picking winners and losers. And, you know, as much as I'm pro Bitcoin and pro ETH, you know, the SEC people forget this, but XRP used to be the 2nd most valuable digital asset after Bitcoin. The United States SEC then gets involved in picking winners and saying, hey.\n\nETH gets a pass, but XRP doesn't. And, look, this is very, in my view, very un American. And and to your point, I think it used to be I just asked for a level playing field. It it does feel like and I think certainly what if you look at the crypto markets as a barometer, it would you know, this administration is putting America first. And, well, I mean, we we shall see it's still you you know, there's things to play out and things do happen, but I think indications are that, you know, if, for example, there is a there's some talk about a crypto reserve, you know, I think that would end up including Bitcoin and other technologies, which, you know, frankly, just makes sense from a diversification point of view.\n\nAnd so I I'm I'm very optimistic that the the it is a new dawn for the crypto industry in United States. The crypto sorry. The United States has led in many technical innovations, and it was leading in crypto, and some of the leading global companies are based here in the United States. But the the the last, you know, handful of years in the Biden administration have been very hostile towards crypto, maybe amongst the most hostile on the planet, and that's coming to an end. So, that that's gonna be good for the the the companies that, you know, the the Ripple included.\n\nYeah. Yeah. And and just having clarity, more rules of road, capital flows, whether it's into, investing in, businesses, tokens, new innovation would seem to accelerate here, on the other side of this or getting that clarity. And so I'm curious. Are there are there areas that you think about as maybe have been held back from an innovation perspective and we're about to really unlock them or just interesting use cases, that that, you know, you feel like now have a chance to to to see if they can can move forward?\n\nLike, are are the whether it's at Ripple or just more broadly, are the things you think could be interesting? Yeah. Well, so first of all, one of the things you said there that I I just wanna comment on is, you know, some people, particularly the Elizabeth Warrens of the world, you know, would espouse this idea that the the crypto industry doesn't want to be regulated. The exact opposite is true. What the what the industry has been asking for is clear rules of the road so that we can be regulated.\n\nWe know how to manage within that, and the vast, vast, vast majority of people I know in crypto want to be good actors. We just need to know what that looks like. So to your point, it's not that people want deregulation. They want clear regulation, and and I think we're on the cusp of of getting that. The second part of your question, I have for I missed speak around innovation or or areas that that you think could flourish Right.\n\nRight. Yeah. With with more clear regulation? Well, I mean, the first thing is, I think most of the major financial institutions in the United States have taken a view of we're gonna lean out until there's clarity because we we don't wanna take the risk. We we we don't wanna be in the crosshairs of Gary Gensler, so we're just gonna sit out.\n\nOut. That has started to change, and you've seen some really pioneering well, the minimum pioneering comments and beyond that from the BlackRocks of the world with I and I do think to your point on some pioneering areas, I think tokenization of real world assets, I think the is an area we're gonna see a lot of activity once, you know, there is some of that clarity because you're gonna see financial institutions realize that tokenization reduces friction. It reduces cost, improves the overall efficiency of transactions. And I think there's a bunch of industries where the efficiency of a a financial transaction is high friction. And so, you know, that we can do this better.\n\nAnd when we do this better, the US economy operates more efficiently, and that's good for everybody. You know, I I, Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood, commented publicly that, you know, by virtue of the work they had done to build out settlements of crypto, in their infrastructure, they're actually able to reduce by an order of magnitude the cost of their securities settlement. That's a very big deal. Here, an order of magnitude decrease, in costs. And, you know, their customers benefit from that.\n\nSo, you know, again, I I I think we should start from how do we help the United States be competitive? How do we help the United States consumer? How do we help the United States small business? These are technologies that unlock efficiency at scale. Ripples focused on one set of problems.\n\nThere's a a bunch of other amazing companies doing stuff in other verticals that I get super excited about. And I think it's good for the industry, and I think, you know, all boats can rise. Yeah. Yeah. Great.\n\nIn terms of XRP, so, obviously, been on a really, meteoric rise here. I think it's up, 5 x maybe since pre election. So, you know, huge run. There's been XRP ETF file. We're talking about, crypto reserve potentially as you just talked about, things that could be driving enthusiasm, US centric, blockchains, institutional new demand.\n\nYou know? What do you think, in the market narrative? Maybe maybe a hit on a bunch of things. But just talk about kind of the demand for XRP, and and where do you see the market market moving? I'm not sure how much you can share on the token itself.\n\nBut, yeah, I'd love to hear about what you think is going on. Well, I mean, the the good news is it's open source technology to the extent I I I, for better horse, don't necessarily have that much proprietary. Like, here's where it's going. My optimism around crypto at large is very high, and it's because some of the things we've already talked about. It's because, you know, the vast majority of cryptos are very inflation resistant.\n\nSo, I think that the market overall you know, I predicted about just about a year ago, maybe 13 months ago, I think I predicted that the market might hit as high as 5,000,000,000,000 this year. That, you know, with only a month left, that seems aggressive. But, you know, I think at the time we were at 1.5 to 1.8, you know, now we're at 3 0.5 trillion all in, and, you know, I'm I'm optimistic it'll continue to trend upward between here now and the end of the year. Your XRP specifically yeah. I I think many people forget because it might be new to crypto.\n\nIt wasn't that long ago that XRP was the 2nd most valuable digital asset. And, again, that's before you had these exogenous factors that I would say were unnatural, may may maybe not ethical in debates, but, you know, and I think now you're seeing that change. And I think, you know, with a level playing field, if you I almost think about it as if you hold a a a basketball under the water long enough, eventually, you let go of it, and, yeah, it shoots up. But why are we surprised by this? You know?\n\nSomebody was holding it underwater, and now it's it's it's it's rising. So, look, I I I feel like, it feels somewhat vindicating. I'll be honest to you. And but, you know, I think we should measure these over a long arc of time. I'd I'd encourage Ripple employees.\n\nYes. We we are aware XRP has gone up in value, but we really do try to take a very long term view about, you know, what we're building and how that contributes to an Internet of value and how XRP can be a critical component of an Internet of value. Yeah. Yeah. So you're, like, trying to disconnect some of the speculation from, obviously, the use case and and ultimately how to think about the value.\n\nBut, you know, my work as an analyst, you know, we look at flow of funds, you know, covered stocks for 20 plus years. And when you remove a huge barrier to inflows, what happens is and and there's demand, price goes up. And, you know, so we've been obviously talking about these ETFs, and I still personally think we're in the very early innings of demand into just even the Bitcoin ETFs, let alone as people kinda go down the path into other, other, assets. And and so, you know, that that's 100 of 1,000,000,000 of dollars, in my opinion, over the next few years. And then you talk about demand from something like a reserve, which, in my opinion, is it would probably, far surpass the demand for even the ETF.\n\nSo, you you know, it's an interesting dynamic of, like, trying to set price on something where you essentially had a massive restriction on, the ability to to buy the the demand side. And so, if if price discovery is gonna be interesting here for a while, I think. Yeah. Look. I I agree with a 1000% of that.\n\nAnd, you know, I I'm a optimistic guy who likes to look forward about where the world's going. You know, I I do hope there is a little bit of backward looking reflection about, what went on here. And, you know, I I I think there's some some some not great facts that I hope come to light. So, like, I think it'll be interesting to see where things settle out. It is shocking.\n\nYou know, I have pointed out public or sorry, privately to friends, but I'd point out, you know, semi publicly here. You can now put a price on the SEC's weight on the crypto market. Right? The the the s c has been sitting, you know, but their knee has been on the neck of the crypto market. And when the neck when that knee came off, the value went from about 2.3 trillion, I think, to about 3.5 trillion.\n\nSo that cost was over a $1,000,000,000,000 you know, Gary Gensler's knee removed is worth a $1,000,000,000,000. You know, when we think about the SEC's mission being to protect investors, that's the first sentence of their mission. You know, it's it's puzzling, and it's no wonder why so many people are frustrated with how the SEC behaved in this administration. And it it I think it's actually sad because it's eroded the credibility and, you know, we we should be proud of our our government agencies and the the work they do on behalf of, of citizens. Just sort of That's my editorial opinion.\n\nYou can skip over that. Understood. Yes. So in terms of the the the Ripple business itself and and the valuation considerations, so, obviously, there's an $11,000,000,000, tender offer. The stock had been trading kinda lower valuations, in the, private markets.\n\nNow, obviously, you hold XRP on the balance sheet too. So, like, that probably changes the whole math quite a bit given the rise in XRP. But how do you think about the valuation of Ripple and and both kind of in the absolute sense and and ways that, you know, institutions should be thinking about it potentially that we'd be looking at in the private markets, and then that dynamic of, the now you've shifted the the price of XRP as well. So I think the the old constructs maybe changed a little bit, but the valuation framework of of how you the pieces may may be similar. So I'd love to get you to kinda hear about that and maybe the disconnect as well.\n\nYeah. So, you know, look. I don't think about as a kind of there's up to the minute valuation stuff. But I I think it's safe to assume that the 11,000,000,000 is very outdated at this point. It you know, the the total value of the XRP we own now exceeds a 100,000,000,000, and, you know, that that is, you know, another mark.\n\nYou know, one of the things I don't know how to get my head around exactly is, you know, the the way that Ripple is traded in the secondary private markets has been at a significant discount to net asset value. You know, some would say MicroStrategy is comparable in some ways, but trades at a, I think, 3 x premium to net asset value. And you think, That's that's interesting. I I know, again, I'm not anti micro strategy, I hope, is a massive success and keeps doing what they're doing. And, like, you know, Ripple has been in a position where we have not prioritized going public.\n\nThat didn't really make any sense in the previous SEC administration. Maybe that changes in the future, and, you know, we'll evaluate that as as things unfold. Excellent. Just so, Brad, to to wrap things up here, just wanna talk about the longer term outlook for both. So we hit on hit on a lot.\n\nBut you think about the business over the next 5 years, and I and I know, like, a lot has to evolve here even though the next 6 months to probably fully answer this question. But when you think about kind of your vision for this company and and what you want it to really look like, what what are maybe some of the broad strokes of kind of where where you see it going or or your aspirations? And then what are some of the maybe, KPIs or or ways that you would judge, you know, whether you're being successful or how how someone from the outside could think about that? I I believe Ripple is now and will continue to be the the go to blockchain infrastructure company for finance institutions and and really enable enable the ability for them to deliver services to their customers at scale. And, yeah, that's where we have been.\n\nThat's where we're gonna continue to focus. Yeah. We've seen payment volumes continue to grow. We're seeing tremendous demand for our custody solutions. I think there's a lot of excitement about Ripple USD, RL USD launching for a whole bunch of reasons.\n\nSome of them we talked about today. So, I you know, look. Before you and I got on the the recorded part of this, I commented that it feels like I've spent years of headwinds coming at me, you know, fighting against the SEC and fighting our own government that we pay taxes to. And I feel like we're now on the other side of that, and it feels like some really exciting tailwinds that allows us to play offense in a way we haven't in a long while. And we have an incredible team here, I'll tell you, that has been resilient through that those those headwinds.\n\nBut, the inbound demand that we are seeing just in the last few weeks as the, you know, the the winds have changed, has just been profound, exciting, a little exhausting. But, you know, I I I think we find ourselves in a really good place, and I think that's good for Ripple. And, honestly, Devin, it's good for the whole XRP ecosystem for the, the liquidity. I mean, it you know, the FalconX team tweeted out today that between the first and second halves of q 4, they saw a 10 x growth in volume. There are a bunch of days recently where there's been more, XRP liquidity in terms of volume of trades than there has been in Bitcoin.\n\nBut it it look. I think this will settle out where it settles out. I think I'm really pleased that, you know, we we survived the onslaught, and, you know, some unfortunately didn't. You know, the SCC did kill some crypto companies that otherwise may have survived and may have gone on to build, you know, great solutions for business and customers, and that's, you know, an unfortunate reality. But Ripple finds itself in a great position, with, I think, you know, the most robust product suite we've had ever.\n\nAnd, you know, I think it's a lot of tailwinds from here. Alright. Well, I think we can leave it there. But, Brad, thank you for doing this. You know, I know, this past past month has been a whirlwind, for you, and I'm sure exhausting, but also, you said exciting.\n\nAnd, you know, we're really excited to see what the next few months look like from here And, we'd love to do this again and just get an update on, you know, how things are coming together, especially as you get more clarity. So, great to see you. Great, conversation, and, wish you the best here, into the end of the year, and and we'll catch up on the other side. Thank you very much, Devin. It's good to talk to you.\n\nYeah. You as well. Thanks so much. Thanks, everyone.",

        "content": "Good afternoon, everyone.\n---\nI'm Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens JMP.\n---\nIt's a pleasure to have Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs with me today.\n---\nRipple is one of the largest and most successful companies in the digital asset space.\n---\nAnd the goal here today is really, to help educate our institutional clients on Ripple's business model, the opportunity going forward, and then also gain some perspective on, what's going on in the industry and where we're evolving to.\n---\nObviously, I think a lot of talk lot to talk about in there.\n---\nSo, Brad, first off, great to see you.\n---\nI know you're a busy man these days, and there's a lot going on.\n---\nBut, you know, we're about 1 month post election here.\n---\nYou can kinda feel the optimism building in the room, and and I think there's a lot to get into around that.\n---\nBut but, really, maybe, I think the best place to start is your journey, to Ripple in 2015.\n---\nYou know, you you came to Ripple well before, I think the company was a household name well before people really understood blockchain technology and that move moving into the mainstream.\n---\nSo I'd love to just get that perspective first, and I think we have a lot, to catch up on.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI appreciate it.\n---\nWell, thanks for thanks for having me.\n---\nThere is a lot going on, and I agree with your earlier comment of, you know, it, very good and kinda post election world.\n---\nSo I I first was exposed to Bitcoin actually in 2012.\n---\nPeter Thiel and a guy named Orin Hoffman run an annual conference called Dialog.\n---\nI think it happens twice a year now, but, and there was a session on Bitcoin.\n---\nI'd never heard of it and, participated with some of my friends.\n---\nYou know, this Dialog is not really you're not really spoken at, but kind of small groups.\n---\nAnd I don't remember who the advocate was.\n---\nIt might have been Mickey Malka, but, talking about Bitcoin.\n---\nAnd at the time, I was doing some angel investing, and so I kind of treated it as, okay.\n---\nYou know, it might go to 0.\n---\nIt's something better.\n---\nI I, frankly, I always worried that the Achilles' heel of Bitcoin might be this kind of anti bank, anti government sentiment.\n---\nAnd, you know, it's just to me, it limited the market opportunity if you're gonna take a a that approach because I feel like governments aren't gonna go away, banks aren't gonna go away in my opinion.\n---\nSo years later, a recruiter actually called me and introduced me to Ripple.\n---\nAnd what resonated with me right out of the gates was this idea of how do we work with the legacy infrastructure, what we now would call TradFi.\n---\nAnd, you know, that included government and certainly banks, and it it resonated with me that Ripple is trying to work with the system rather than, create a fully new system.\n---\nThere's obviously, you know, arguments on both sides of that.\n---\nI can see those arguments.\n---\nBut, from the very earliest days, Ripple's kinda taken approach of we're going to be a bridge between decentralized finance and traditional finance and, bring products to market to help help bridge those both, frankly, culturally, technologically, etcetera.\n---\nSo that's that's how my journey began.\n---\nAs you pointed out, I joined in 2015, through, you know, a little luck, a little skill.\n---\nWe find ourselves in a really compelling place with a bunch of customers and, you know, scaling products.\n---\nSo we're pretty pleased about that.\n---\nSo talk a little bit about the the business journey of Ripple itself.\n---\nSo, you know, Ripple payments to then custody, sounds like an imminent, stable coin.\n---\nSo just talk a little bit about the journey of an evolution of the company up until today.\n---\nSo, you know, when when I first joined Ripple, this is again back in 2015, we were kind of at this we were a small company, fewer than a 100 people, thinking about your different use cases around how do you leverage these blockchain technologies and to some degree, how do you use the XRP Ledger in particular to build, you know, use cases that are interesting.\n---\nAnd there were 3 products at the company when I first joined or 3 experiments at the company when I joined.\n---\nYou know, one was around infrastructure payments where we're particularly on cross border infrastructure payments.\n---\nThe second was around a project called Codius, which is a smart contract platform on the XRP Ledger.\n---\nAnd then the third, was a something around identity management.\n---\nAnd, you know, one of the first things I really decided is there's no chance we can do all 3 of these things, and let's pick 1.\n---\nAnd this maybe was a kind of harking back to, my days at Yahoo and kind of you can't spread yourself too thin around, Yahoo to try to do anything.\n---\nSo we decided to focus on, cross border payments and selling into the enterprise and financial institutions.\n---\nAnd, yeah, that journey has evolved when, you know, we started with kind of generation 1 product, I guess, generation 2.\n---\nWe're now kind of generation 3, but all kind of focused on that same point that the the the costs and the, delays and the the error rates around the kind of traditional cross border payments architecture are pretty flawed.\n---\nThere's a whole bunch of interesting companies doing stuff around the front end of that.\n---\nDidn't realize I can get hearts out of that.\n---\nThat was kinda cool.\n---\nBut there's a whole bunch of things around the front end of that, but not many companies are focused on the back end and the infrastructure side of that and really kind of building a better swift.\n---\nPart of your question there was, you know, we started just doing payments, and what we realized is that in order to do it well, you needed to have robust infrastructure around custody.\n---\nAnd, I guess, close to 18 months ago, we bought a company based in Switzerland called Medeco, which was really due to winning a lot of market share, at the tier one bank level of selling the the technology to banks, so they could safely and, you know, manage and manage and custody crypto, themselves.\n---\nAnd as you said, we are getting close very, very close to launching, we call Ripple USD, a stablecoin.\n---\nThe the history of that really quickly is we have been using stablecoins in our payment flows for a a long time, years.\n---\nAnd at one point, we found ourselves we were responsible for minting about 20% of all USDC.\n---\nAnd we kinda started to ask ourselves, wait a minute.\n---\nYou know, is there a way that we should be a principal in this market?\n---\nAnd for a whole bunch of reasons, we decided to jump in.\n---\nWe will launch very soon, under the auspices of the New York DFS trust license, which we are, very close to finalizing.\n---\nCan you talk a little bit about the blockchain piece of it?\n---\nBecause I think, you know, I've worked in traditional finance for over 20 years.\n---\nYou know, cover traditional financial firms, but also cover digital asset firms.\n---\nAnd I think, you know, a lot of institutional clients who were educating on the blockchain technology, they're trying to understand, like, the application of it in into traditional finance and why is this the right structure for for payments as an example, or, you know, what what what is the value prop of a stablecoin itself versus just, you know, the the you whatever may be within payments or remittance or Yep.\n---\nOr any other use cases of of stablecoins?"

        "original_index": 1,
        "content": "---\nWell, so, I mean, for me, there's 2 questions in there.\n---\nYou know, one is the second one is on stablecoins.\n---\nThe first one, you know, what you know, how is blockchain embedded there?\n---\nI mean, to me, the novelty of a blockchain is allowing 2 parties to transact who don't have they they don't have a relationship, but to do that with without trust, but with certainty.\n---\nSo today, that that doesn't really exist.\n---\nRight?\n---\nWhen you are transacting today, someone is passing the trust bar between.\n---\nSo, you know, if you use your Visa card, Visa is the trusted party between the mer you and the merchant don't have any trust.\n---\nVisa has trust on both sides, and so they are taking a premium, to pass that trust.\n---\nThere's a whole bunch of financial examples where the the settlement between two transactions, there's a a central counterparty that's extracting value to commute the trust between those two parties.\n---\nIf you can do that without the central counterparty, you're gonna increase speed.\n---\nYou're gonna decrease cost.\n---\nYou're improving efficiency and, you know, or by by removing a step, you're probably improving error rates.\n---\nAnd so what you're finding is, I think, there will be more and more examples of how people apply a blockchain to improve the efficiency of a transaction.\n---\nSo so you don't have to have a central counterparty.\n---\nIn the payments business, you know, sometimes you have multiple, hops along a journey when you're sending money cross border.\n---\nAnd, you know, each of those hops adds time, adds cost, adds complexity, adds risk of error.\n---\nAnd, you know, our view has, for a long time, really been, how is it that we have an Internet of information that allows any piece information to transmit instantly, interoperably across many networks, but you don't have the ability to do that money?\n---\nIn some ways, and I say this as a guy who was involved in the early days of the Internet, it is reminiscent of, you know, you had Prodigi, you had AOL, America Online, and you had CompuServe.\n---\nBut if you, Devin, wanted to send me an email from CompuServe to Prodigi, and I was on Prodigi, you that was not actually possible.\n---\nYou had to have an account as a closed network.\n---\nWell, along come technologies like HTTP and TCPIP, and in the email case, SMTP that allowed interoperability between the closed networks and thus the Internet of information.\n---\nWe really think about the the closed networks of payment networks.\n---\nSome of those are on a national scale.\n---\nRight?\n---\nYou have domestically closed networks.\n---\nBut look.\n---\nPayPal is effectively a closed network.\n---\nVenmo is a closed network.\n---\nVisa is a closed network.\n---\nAnd the interoperability between these networks is actually what, you know, people are extracting lots of, tolls for to allow that to pass between them.\n---\nAnd that that's where the inefficiency comes.\n---\nSo from our point of view, the the Internet of information is being is is giving way to the Internet of value, the Internet of money, and allowing money to move the way information moves today.\n---\nAnd that's gonna be at a much lower cost, much faster, lower error rates.\n---\nAnd so, we we have been selling into the the infrastructure layer now for years.\n---\nAnd as I mentioned earlier, we're kind of our 3rd generation product, and, you know, doing 1,000,000,000 of dollars of transactions and then obviously selling custody and other solutions, and potentially other things beyond that in the coming years.\n---\nAnd there still needs to be trust in in Ripple as a business and as you're going out and and bring in new customers.\n---\nSo how talk about that journey and just the the building of trust and and the brand awareness because you're, in some ways, you're competing against a traditional financial system.\n---\nYou're also competing against other potential blockchain business models that that wanna do something similar.\n---\nYou guys have built a massive business already, and and to me, it still feels like we're very early days.\n---\nSo talk about the building trust and the education in the market and and where you think we we are in that process.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI'll I'll start at the end of that one.\n---\nI I think that the most interesting part is trying to figure out where are we in this journey.\n---\nAnd I I'll use the Internet, of information as a comparison.\n---\nYou know, a lot of people think the Internet started in the nineties.\n---\nNetscape was born in 95.\n---\nBut, really, the the Internet really was born in the early seventies out of, you know, the the DARPA and then ARPANET or ARPANET, DARPANET, whatever.\n---\nAnd, you know, then you connect universities, and then you end up getting, a particular school in Illinois connected, and they launched the Mosaic browser.\n---\nAnd each step was about simplicity and simplifying the use of these networks.\n---\nWell, I think you\n---\nand I would probably agree using the crypto networks, blockchains, is not simple today.\n---\nThen it I mean, even for someone who's deep into it, sometimes I'm I\n---\nI find it frustrating.\n---\nAnd I I think we are still in the kind of almost DARPA net stage of blockchain where we haven't yet had the birth of Mosaic or the birth of Detscape that unlocks more and more simplicity.\n---\nAnd it's frankly one of the reasons why Ripple has focused at the enterprise level because we can, frankly, obfuscate a lot of that complexity of using blockchain such that our customers don't even have to see or touch that, but still have the benefit of improved speed, improved cost, improved error rates.\n---\nSo, I I think we're we're early in that journey.\n---\nI think there's gonna be, you know, a bunch of significant winners.\n---\nI mean, some people would say, well, you already have a bunch of big winners.\n---\nBitcoin's at 1.8 trillion.\n---\nETH is, you know, 400 to 500,000,000,000.\n---\nBut, you know, we really only gonna have the winners once you really have the scaled utility scaled use cases that are solving real problems for customers.\n---\nI think we probably all agree that right now, there's a lot of speculation in the market and some utility, some other pieces.\n---\nBut, you know, Ripple has always tried to focus on okay.\n---\nWe're solving problems for customers.\n---\nWe're not trying to lean into meme coins, for example.\n---\nYou know, you you can use the XRP Ledger as open source technology to do meme coins if you would choose to do so.\n---\nAnd, frankly, there are examples of that happening on the XRP Ledger, right, because it's open source technology.\n---\nRipple and, like, how do we build trust is how do we make sure that, you know, our customers understand, you know, where where the kind of products we're bringing to market and that they work well, and they're adding value.\n---\nAnd, you know, I I feel very good.\n---\nIt it's been a long journey.\n---\nIn in some ways, ironically, maybe the the SEC lawsuit against Ripple added trust to some degree.\n---\nYou know?\n---\nBecause we prevailed well, because we fought the fight and, you know, prevailed on the kind of the key points that mattered, I think a lot of people, it it built trust, as well.\n---\nAnd so I I do feel good about, you know, how ripple has emerged from some of this, but I I also would say to my earlier point, I think we're still in the early days.\n---\nAnd, the journey ahead, I'm I'm very excited about.\n---\nI wanna come back on the stable coins."

        "content": "---\nYou talked for a moment about kind of the the value of of having your own stable coin.\n---\nBut can can you maybe just expand a little bit on that and and the structure of what the stablecoin at Ripple is gonna look like relative to maybe some others in the market?\n---\nAnd then I think questions around just how that works with XRP, you know, how's complimentary and and actually drives value to the to the, XRP Ledger.\n---\nI think that would be great to understand that better.\n---\nSure.\n---\nSo, you know, as I'm sure many people who, you know, follow you are well aware, and I know you\n---\nyou know this pretty well, you know, the the the stablecoin market today globally is about $200,000,000,000.\n---\nAbout 70% of that is Tether or USDT.\n---\nProbably another, you know, 20% of that is USDC, which is Circle's kind of solution in the marketplace.\n---\nAnd then there's a a longer tail after that of, you know, smaller players.\n---\nYou know, Tether is, you know, by I'm pro Tether and an advocate.\n---\nThe US government, I think, is less so.\n---\nThat may change also, but, you know, Tether has intentionally set up outside the United States, outside of kind of the the the long arm of the the US, regulator.\n---\nAnd, you know, I think that gives some major institutions pause about, you know, interest in working with them.\n---\nAnd our view has been there's an opportunity for a a trusted brand like Ripple, who has a lot of experience with institutions, a lot of experience with payment flows, to bring a a product to market that is truly the the the the most trusted, you know, that we will be the first to come out under, with a New York trust license.\n---\nYou know, we will be doing quarterly attest excuse me, monthly attestations.\n---\nAnd, you know, I I think we're we do have our own balance sheet that, you know, in a if problems were to exist, we we were in a position to actually help solve those.\n---\nSo, now how will it coexist with XRP?\n---\nYou know, I well, first of all, on the any liquidity on the XRP Ledger is a good thing.\n---\nIt's good for the whole XRP ecosystem.\n---\nAnd the more liquidity on there, including the stablecoins, it it reduces friction and the ability to do things, particularly in the DeFi world.\n---\nThere's some native technologies embedded in the XRP Ledger, a decentralized exchange, DEX, a AMM automated market maker, and embedding a stablecoin, a robust stablecoin, a trusted stablecoin like Ripple USD, we think will actually help that.\n---\nI don't think it competes with XRP as a different solution because, really, we think about that as the bridge currency.\n---\nRight?\n---\nSo it it rl USD, Ripple USD is a dollar.\n---\nThe bridge currency is going in and out of other currencies and having the most liquid, most efficient bridge currency between between various currencies around the world, we think, is a needed solution, in scaling global commerce.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nAnd in terms of the customers, you you touched on a little bit.\n---\nBut, you know, historically, b to b and banks, payer providers, merchants, institutions, Talk about how these different customer groups have used Ripple over time, how that's evolved.\n---\nAnd then, I'm assuming Stablecoin opens you up probably even more b to c as well, you know, with more applications.\n---\nSo maybe just so we can kind of think about, that evolution\n---\nand then also, you know, where we go from here with customers.\n---\nWe our our focus from a customer point of view has always been b to b.\n---\nI think it'll remain b to b.\n---\nYou know, while a stablecoin can be used by consumers in the very nature is once it exists on your various exchanges, anybody can access it and use it however they'd like.\n---\nOur focus will be in serving institutional clients, serving financial institutions.\n---\nYou know, over time, we may serve, you know, corporates in some some regard, but our focus remains very much, on b to b, kind of on the infrastructure layer, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.\n---\nMhmm.\n---\nWell, in terms of the between payment solutions or or custody solutions, are there different customers using the firm for, you know, a single point solution, or is it a is it a holistic relationship?\n---\nOr where do you see either opportunity for it to go, or or where is it kinda naturally already been going?\n---\nI mean, honestly, Deb, this is one of the things that gets me kinda most excited about, you know, the the the road ahead.\n---\nYou know, when we first started with the the payments, piece of cross border payments piece years ago, we were trying to mostly focus on tier 1 banks.\n---\nWhat we found because that's where, really, the cross border payments activity at really big scales, existed.\n---\nWhat we found for a whole bunch of reasons is, you know, the the classic innovator's dilemma, a reluctance to move quickly, then, of course, you have US regulatory stuff and the SEC lawsuit that only impacted that more.\n---\nWhat we found, though, is all and we still have a number of customers in the tier one banks around payments, but we found a lot of demand, in, you know, payment providers, tier 2 banks, tier 3 banks, particularly outside the United States.\n---\nThe SEC sued us in December of 2020, and that evolved to where we are today where 95% of our customers are non US financial institutions.\n---\nAnd, you know, I don't think I don't know that that unlocks yet.\n---\nYou will see as, you know, the coming regulatory changes, I think, many people expect in the Trump administration, but, I I'm sort of excited about that unlock.\n---\nNow part of your question, I think, is, you know, the the cross sell.\n---\nRight?\n---\nSo, the custody customers that we we have today and where we continue to get a lot of traction is in the tier one banks.\n---\nAnd so we feel like there's an opportunity, and we are seeing we don't require the cross sell.\n---\nYou can, you know, choose to not work with us around custody and work with us around payments.\n---\nAnd I think that will certainly remain the case.\n---\nBut we're seeing more and more that we, Ripple, can be the trusted first choice for solving a bank's or financial institution's, desires and needs around all things blockchain.\n---\nSo that's really where we wanna build the brand and build the the, excuse me, build the product suite.\n---\nMhmm.\n---\nExcellent.\n---\nWanna pivot a little bit and talk about election, and, obviously, we can go a lot of directions here.\n---\nBut, you know, it it feels like this could be seminal moment for the space, and you guys have been already doing a lot of hard work and scale.\n---\nBut, new administration, people that are already coming together in place, there's rumors about SEC as well here.\n---\nIt seems like it could be favorable to the industry.\n---\nSo what what are the if you if you had your way, you know, and and and, you know, things open up and maybe it felt like doors have been closed, like, what are the what are the the primary things you wanna do?\n---\nAnd maybe I'll start there, but I I think, you know, there there's so much more to go into.\n---\nBut just some of the big, changes that you feel like you can come out of this and and position Ripple, for the future.\n---\nAnd, again, there's a lot of uncertainty still, but, it does feel like there is a real tone change.\n---\nYeah."

        "content": "---\nI mean, I think there has been a real tone change.\n---\nIt's just kind of there's still, steps to take.\n---\nYou know?\n---\nI I think there does need to be legislation passed to provide some of the the clarity around, particularly, you know, securities laws where the SEC has been, I think I mean, abusive would be almost a generous word.\n---\nYou know, and the way they have approached it and kind of regulation through enforcement, it's it's not just been, you know, not constructive.\n---\nI think, arguably, you know, you've had judges come out and say, it's been arbitrary and capricious.\n---\nThat's a quote.\n---\nAnother quote, and a federal judge said the SEC hasn't followed a faithful allegiance to law.\n---\nThat's a quote, in a particular case in a Utah federal court.\n---\nYou know, the SEC was sanctioned for misrepresentations to the court.\n---\nSo, like, the this SEC has been, I think, again, generous to say unethical.\n---\nIt is changing for sure.\n---\nAnd I think all of the Trump appointees that we have seen so far, you know, Scott Bessens at Treasury, I think, is gonna be an outstanding choice and is certainly excited about being pro innovation and how these technologies and how we can put America first and invest in these technologies rather than pushing them offshore.\n---\nI mean, honestly, Devin, you you know, I get fired up about this stuff.\n---\nBut the irony of what was happening is we were saying we're we're gonna treat the US companies harsher and push activity offshore where it's less regulated and more risky instead of actually supporting US companies and helping and providing clear rules of the road.\n---\nI think we will get some legislative clarity.\n---\nThere's a bill called fit 21 that passed the house, last summer.\n---\nYou know, probably I don't know if you'd be a derivative of that or something new, but I think in the first half of next year, we'll see, legislation that, you know, provides some clarity that will move more of the responsibility towards the CFTC.\n---\nI as of today, I believe Paul Atkins has been appointed as SEC chair, and I think he's an outstanding choice.\n---\nAnd I think, you know, he's very knowledgeable about this industry.\n---\nAnd, you know, I I think it's a good thing for the the crypto industry to have this this change happening, and I think, it sets up for a very pro innovation, pro crypto, federal government.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nIt would seem We can go on more on that stuff.\n---\nBut Yeah.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nAnd I I and there's I think there's more to get into.\n---\nAnd I and I guess just the from a legislative perspective, this was really the first selection where this was a a front and center topic, and and clearly, it moved the needle.\n---\nAnd it doesn't feel like we're going back in any like, the genie's out of the bottle here, and it can only go one direction.\n---\nAnd so you have legislators in the house and senate that the majority are on record being, I think, positive on the industry.\n---\nSo in terms of just the ability to actually get something done in DC or closer to it even than I am, like, does it does it feel like post election, there's still real momentum, whether it's fit 21 or or something something else that, like, this will be, you know, a priority in this next administration.\n---\nAnd and really, you know, it's great that there's in in the administration, but you really need the the legislators to to to to act.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI'm very optimistic, and I I think there's a bunch of data points to support that.\n---\nAnd to get to your point, is it fit 21 or a derivative fit 21?\n---\nI don't know.\n---\nYou know?\n---\nJD Vance as a senator, his office had written a proposed bill around market structure for crypto.\n---\nIt was never introduced, but I I think given that JD Vance's office had was drafted that, I think that that also might get a a seriously look, and I think that's a very positive, bill in providing the clarity the industry has asked for.\n---\nSo I'm very optimistic that that will happen.\n---\nI think on the federal side, I mean, there's a lot of attention right now around something that also has really stymied and restrained constrained growth of this industry in the United States, which is, you you know, loosely called operation choke point 2.0, which has been the debanking of crypto and kinda the in the shadows, in the whispers.\n---\nAnd that debanking was done in maybe continues.\n---\nI don't know.\n---\nYou know, Ripple has had problems with that.\n---\nYou know, I personally got debanked.\n---\nYou know, it it\n---\nit's really, in my view, super un American.\n---\nYou know, these are law abiding.\n---\nRipple and, again, we now have that from a federal court court.\n---\nThe SEC certainly investigated us for years and read every email I ever wrote.\n---\nSo, you know, if there was bad acts that they would have I'm sure they would have happily gone after it.\n---\nSo, I think my guess is there'll be an executive order very early in the Trump administration, putting an end to this operation choke point 2.0.\n---\nAnd I think, you know, it it sounds maybe kinda small, but just the ability for companies in our industry and for people in our industry to get bank accounts, particularly when Ripple, in particular, is trying to be that bridge between traditional finance and this decentralized finance world.\n---\nYou know, I think that's good for the industry.\n---\nI think it's good for America.\n---\nI think it's good for US job growth.\n---\nI think it's good for US technical leadership.\n---\nAnd so I think we we will see more putting US companies first, putting US technologies first in the Trump administration.\n---\nAnd I think there really is a chance to make crypto great again in the United States.\n---\nAnd, it's been, you know, a both a public and private war against crypto for for years here in United States, and so I'm excited to turn the page on that.\n---\nMhmm.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nAnd it seems like there's an undercurrent also.\n---\nYou just mentioned it kind of the US technology, US blockchain.\n---\nI think my sense is that's been helping, valuations of the industry, but, you know, maybe that's part of when you talk about XRP move.\n---\nBut, US blockchain potentially even now potentially moving back where where you get better treatment because you built the technology.\n---\nI know it's a global technology, and it's a global company.\n---\nBut, you know, is that is that relevant to you?\n---\nAnd, you know, there's there's obviously proposals or at least talk about 0 taxes on crypto.\n---\nHow how big would that be?\n---\nI mean, are there things like that that you feel like kind of maybe put Ripple as a business in even better position than than otherwise would be if it was, you know, US wasn't maybe getting favored, going forward?\n---\nBecause it seems like that that is maybe the position that this administration has taken.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI mean, like, years ago, before Biden was elected, you know, what we were the the words I used to use is, like, I just wanna level playing field.\n---\nLike, the US government shouldn't be picking winners and losers.\n---\nAnd, you know, as much as I'm pro Bitcoin and pro ETH, you know, the SEC people forget this, but XRP used to be the 2nd most valuable digital asset after Bitcoin.\n---\nThe United States SEC then gets involved in picking winners and saying, hey."

        "content": "---\nETH gets a pass, but XRP doesn't.\n---\nAnd, look, this is very, in my view, very un American.\n---\nAnd and to your point, I think it used to be I just asked for a level playing field.\n---\nIt it does feel like and I think certainly what if you look at the crypto markets as a barometer, it would you know, this administration is putting America first.\n---\nAnd, well, I mean, we we shall see it's still you\n---\nyou know, there's things to play out and things do happen, but I think indications are that, you know, if, for example, there is a there's some talk about a crypto reserve, you know, I think that would end up including Bitcoin and other technologies, which, you know, frankly, just makes sense from a diversification point of view.\n---\nAnd so I I'm I'm very optimistic that the the it is a new dawn for the crypto industry in United States.\n---\nThe crypto sorry.\n---\nThe United States has led in many technical innovations, and it was leading in crypto, and some of the leading global companies are based here in the United States.\n---\nBut the the the last, you know, handful of years in the Biden administration have been very hostile towards crypto, maybe amongst the most hostile on the planet, and that's coming to an end.\n---\nSo, that that's gonna be good for the the the companies that, you know, the the Ripple included.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nAnd and just having clarity, more rules of road, capital flows, whether it's into, investing in, businesses, tokens, new innovation would seem to accelerate here, on the other side of this or getting that clarity.\n---\nAnd so I'm curious.\n---\nAre there are there areas that you think about as maybe have been held back from an innovation perspective and we're about to really unlock them or just interesting use cases, that that, you know, you feel like now have a chance to to to see if they can can move forward?\n---\nLike, are are the whether it's at Ripple or just more broadly, are the things you think could be interesting?\n---\nYeah.\n---\nWell, so first of all, one of the things you said there that I I just wanna comment on is, you know, some people, particularly the Elizabeth Warrens of the world, you know, would espouse this idea that the the crypto industry doesn't want to be regulated.\n---\nThe exact opposite is true.\n---\nWhat the what the industry has been asking for is clear rules of the road so that we can be regulated.\n---\nWe know how to manage within that, and the vast, vast, vast majority of people I know in crypto want to be good actors.\n---\nWe just need to know what that looks like.\n---\nSo to your point, it's not that people want deregulation.\n---\nThey want clear regulation, and and I think we're on the cusp of of getting that.\n---\nThe second part of your question, I have for I missed speak around innovation or or areas that that you think could flourish Right.\n---\nRight.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nWith with more clear regulation?\n---\nWell, I mean, the first thing is, I think most of the major financial institutions in the United States have taken a view of we're gonna lean out until there's clarity because we we don't wanna take the risk.\n---\nWe we we don't wanna be in the crosshairs of Gary Gensler, so we're just gonna sit out.\n---\nOut.\n---\nThat has started to change, and you've seen some really pioneering well, the minimum pioneering comments and beyond that from the BlackRocks of the world with I\n---\nand I do think to your point on some pioneering areas, I think tokenization of real world assets, I think the is an area we're gonna see a lot of activity once, you know, there is some of that clarity because you're gonna see financial institutions realize that tokenization reduces friction.\n---\nIt reduces cost, improves the overall efficiency of transactions.\n---\nAnd I think there's a bunch of industries where the efficiency of a a financial transaction is high friction.\n---\nAnd so, you know, that we can do this better.\n---\nAnd when we do this better, the US economy operates more efficiently, and that's good for everybody.\n---\nYou know, I I, Vlad, the CEO of Robinhood, commented publicly that, you know, by virtue of the work they had done to build out settlements of crypto, in their infrastructure, they're actually able to reduce by an order of magnitude the cost of their securities settlement.\n---\nThat's a very big deal.\n---\nHere, an order of magnitude decrease, in costs.\n---\nAnd, you know, their customers benefit from that.\n---\nSo, you know, again,\n---\nI I\n---\nI think we should start from how do we help the United States be competitive?\n---\nHow do we help the United States consumer?\n---\nHow do we help the United States small business?\n---\nThese are technologies that unlock efficiency at scale.\n---\nRipples focused on one set of problems.\n---\nThere's a a bunch of other amazing companies doing stuff in other verticals that I get super excited about.\n---\nAnd I think it's good for the industry, and I think, you know, all boats can rise.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nGreat.\n---\nIn terms of XRP, so, obviously, been on a really, meteoric rise here.\n---\nI think it's up, 5 x\n---\nmaybe since pre election.\n---\nSo, you know, huge run.\n---\nThere's been XRP ETF file.\n---\nWe're talking about, crypto reserve potentially as you just talked about, things that could be driving enthusiasm, US centric, blockchains, institutional new demand.\n---\nYou know?\n---\nWhat do you think, in the market narrative?\n---\nMaybe maybe a hit on a bunch of things.\n---\nBut just talk about kind of the demand for XRP, and and where do you see the market market moving?\n---\nI'm not sure how much you can share on the token itself.\n---\nBut, yeah, I'd love to hear about what you think is going on.\n---\nWell, I mean, the the good news is it's open source technology to the extent\n---\nI I I, for better horse, don't necessarily have that much proprietary.\n---\nLike, here's where it's going.\n---\nMy optimism around crypto at large is very high, and it's because some of the things we've already talked about.\n---\nIt's because, you know, the vast majority of cryptos are very inflation resistant.\n---\nSo, I think that the market overall you know, I predicted about just about a year ago, maybe 13 months ago, I think I predicted that the market might hit as high as 5,000,000,000,000 this year.\n---\nThat, you know, with only a month left, that seems aggressive.\n---\nBut, you know, I think at the time we were at 1.5 to 1.8, you know, now we're at 3 0.5 trillion all in, and, you know, I'm I'm optimistic it'll continue to trend upward between here now and the end of the year.\n---\nYour XRP\n---\nspecifically yeah.\n---\nI I think many people forget because it might be new to crypto.\n---\nIt wasn't that long ago that XRP was the 2nd most valuable digital asset.\n---\nAnd, again, that's before you had these exogenous factors that I would say were unnatural, may may maybe not ethical in debates, but, you know, and I think now you're seeing that change.\n---\nAnd I think, you know, with a level playing field, if you I almost think about it as if you hold a a a basketball under the water long enough, eventually, you let go of it, and,\n---\nyeah, it shoots up.\n---\nBut why are we surprised by this?\n---\nYou know?"

        "content": "---\nSomebody was holding it underwater, and now it's it's\n---\nit's it's rising.\n---\nSo, look, I I I feel like, it feels somewhat vindicating.\n---\nI'll be honest to you.\n---\nAnd but, you know, I think we should measure these over a long arc of time.\n---\nI'd I'd encourage Ripple employees.\n---\nYes.\n---\nWe we are aware XRP has gone up in value, but we really do try to take a very long term view about, you know, what we're building and how that contributes to an Internet of value and how XRP can be a critical component of an Internet of value.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nSo you're, like, trying to disconnect some of the speculation from, obviously, the use case and and ultimately how to think about the value.\n---\nBut, you know, my work as an analyst, you know, we look at flow of funds, you know, covered stocks for 20 plus years.\n---\nAnd when you remove a huge barrier to inflows, what happens is and and there's demand, price goes up.\n---\nAnd, you know, so we've been obviously talking about these ETFs, and I still personally think we're in the very early innings of demand into just even the Bitcoin ETFs, let alone as people kinda go down the path into other, other, assets.\n---\nAnd and so, you know, that that's 100 of 1,000,000,000 of dollars, in my opinion, over the next few years.\n---\nAnd then you talk about demand from something like a reserve, which, in my opinion, is it would probably, far surpass the demand for even the ETF.\n---\nSo, you you know, it's an interesting dynamic of, like, trying to set price on something where you essentially had a massive restriction on, the ability to to buy the the demand side.\n---\nAnd so, if if price discovery is gonna be interesting here for a while, I think.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nLook.\n---\nI I agree with a 1000% of that.\n---\nAnd, you know, I I'm a optimistic guy who likes to look forward about where the world's going.\n---\nYou know, I I do hope there is a little bit of backward looking reflection about, what went on here.\n---\nAnd, you know,\n---\nI I I think there's some some some not great facts that I hope come to light.\n---\nSo, like, I think it'll be interesting to see where things settle out.\n---\nIt is shocking.\n---\nYou know, I have pointed out public or sorry, privately to friends, but I'd point out, you know, semi publicly here.\n---\nYou can now put a price on the SEC's weight on the crypto market.\n---\nRight?\n---\nThe the the s c has been sitting, you know, but their knee has been on the neck of the crypto market.\n---\nAnd when the neck when that knee came off, the value went from about 2.3 trillion, I think, to about 3.5 trillion.\n---\nSo that cost was over a $1,000,000,000,000 you know, Gary Gensler's knee removed is worth a $1,000,000,000,000.\n---\nYou know, when we think about the SEC's mission being to protect investors, that's the first sentence of their mission.\n---\nYou know, it's it's puzzling, and it's no wonder why so many people are frustrated with how the SEC behaved in this administration.\n---\nAnd it it\n---\nI think it's actually sad because it's eroded the credibility and, you know, we we should be proud of our our government agencies and the the work they do on behalf of, of citizens.\n---\nJust sort of That's my editorial opinion.\n---\nYou can skip over that.\n---\nUnderstood.\n---\nYes.\n---\nSo in terms of the the the Ripple business itself and and the valuation considerations, so, obviously, there's an $11,000,000,000, tender offer.\n---\nThe stock had been trading kinda lower valuations, in the, private markets.\n---\nNow, obviously, you hold XRP on the balance sheet too.\n---\nSo, like, that probably changes the whole math quite a bit given the rise in XRP.\n---\nBut how do you think about the valuation of Ripple and and both kind of in the absolute sense and and ways that, you know, institutions should be thinking about it potentially that we'd be looking at in the private markets, and then that dynamic of, the now you've shifted the the price of XRP as well.\n---\nSo I think the the old constructs maybe changed a little bit, but the valuation framework of of how you the pieces may may be similar.\n---\nSo I'd love to get you to kinda hear about that and maybe the disconnect as well.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nSo, you know, look.\n---\nI don't think about as a kind of there's up to the minute valuation stuff.\n---\nBut I I think it's safe to assume that the 11,000,000,000 is very outdated at this point.\n---\nIt you know, the the total value of the XRP we own now exceeds a 100,000,000,000, and, you know, that that is, you know, another mark.\n---\nYou know, one of the things I don't know how to get my head around exactly is, you know, the the way that Ripple is traded in the secondary private markets has been at a significant discount to net asset value.\n---\nYou know, some would say MicroStrategy is comparable in some ways, but trades at a, I think, 3 x premium to net asset value.\n---\nAnd you think, That's that's interesting.\n---\nI I know, again, I'm not anti micro strategy, I hope, is a massive success and keeps doing what they're doing.\n---\nAnd, like, you know, Ripple has been in a position where we have not prioritized going public.\n---\nThat didn't really make any sense in the previous SEC administration.\n---\nMaybe that changes in the future, and, you know, we'll evaluate that as as things unfold.\n---\nExcellent.\n---\nJust so, Brad, to to wrap things up here, just wanna talk about the longer term outlook for both.\n---\nSo we hit on hit on a lot.\n---\nBut you think about the business over the next 5 years, and I and I know, like, a lot has to evolve here even though the next 6 months to probably fully answer this question.\n---\nBut when you think about kind of your vision for this company and and what you want it to really look like, what what are maybe some of the broad strokes of kind of where where you see it going or or your aspirations?\n---\nAnd then what are some of the maybe, KPIs or or ways that you would judge, you know, whether you're being successful or how how someone from the outside could think about that?\n---\nI I believe Ripple is now and will continue to be the the go to blockchain infrastructure company for finance institutions and and really enable enable the ability for them to deliver services to their customers at scale.\n---\nAnd, yeah, that's where we have been.\n---\nThat's where we're gonna continue to focus.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nWe've seen payment volumes continue to grow.\n---\nWe're seeing tremendous demand for our custody solutions.\n---\nI think there's a lot of excitement about Ripple USD, RL USD launching for a whole bunch of reasons.\n---\nSome of them we talked about today.\n---\nSo, I you know, look.\n---\nBefore you\n---\nand I got on the the recorded part of this, I commented that it feels like I've spent years of headwinds coming at me, you know, fighting against the SEC and fighting our own government that we pay taxes to.\n---\nAnd I feel like we're now on the other side of that, and it feels like some really exciting tailwinds that allows us to play offense in a way we haven't in a long while.\n---\nAnd we have an incredible team here, I'll tell you, that has been resilient through that those those headwinds."
