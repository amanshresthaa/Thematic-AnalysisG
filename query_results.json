And obviously, we want to supply the factories all year round, and they want a supply all year round.

When we have extreme heat, or anything like that, we just fill in gaps when there’s surplus, things like that.\nSo, you operate locally, regionally and nationally.

        "query": "So, I think, looking a little bit towards the future, if you consider the next few years, and for the longer term, perhaps the next fifteen years, what would you say is your vision for what you might call, ‘Future Food Systems’?\nMy vision for the future – I think sustainability is the key to anything. If we don’t have sustainability, we’ve got problems. I want to bring more farmers on board, to grow our members; to see the benefits of what we’re doing. And also, to look at taking this – we’ve just started off a 7.5kg bag line, it’s a new thing for us, getting closer to the customer, and I think we’ll look at something else to get closer to the customer really and cut the factories out, where we become further down the chain. The closer to the customer we get, the more we’ll get back to the farm.\nSo, ultimately you would have a process that would take the produce directly from the farm, straight to the end customer?\nThat is the ultimate. I think rather than just selling the potato, we’ll slice it, and things like that. Or we’ll put it into ready-made meals. Well maybe not that, but get it ready to go closer to the end user.\nSo, you’re sort of gradually, as you mentioned, bypassing elements of the chain, starting recently with going direct to consumer and that’s the direction you want to take in the future?\nI think one thing is the scale, we need to increase the volumes we trade as a group. And on the other side we need an avenue where we get closer to the customer, to take the volatility out of the job.\nAnd how do you feel this will contribute to sustainability?\nBecause you’ve got [unclear] contracts in front of you. The factories, the customers – to be honest, the customers are quite happy paying a fair price for a good quality product. The problem is market prices – these dealers in the middle, and the factories, are really, when they can do, dropping the price for the farmers. So, we need to move closer to the end product where we can sustain a steady, average price for sustainability. Because in the last two years, we’ve seen the base price collapse to £30-£40 per tonne. And to give you an idea, we need £100-£110 per tonne to cover costs, to break even.\nAnd so, you can charge a fair price to the end customer whilst still getting enough profit to stay in business?\nYes.\nRight, good.\nSo, we need to get close to then cut those rogues out the industry, really.\nOkay, so it’s cutting the rogues out. So, it sounds like you’ve already taken the next step towards doing that by starting a direct-to-customer service?\nYeah, that was done – we launched about four months’ ago.\nAnd this is basically the direction you’re going in, to expand that part of the business?\nIt’s part of it yes. Obviously, there are different areas. We want more growers on board, more customers, and to grow that base we’d need to add more of what we’re doing and probably streamline what we’re doing. So, there’s a three-way approach where we can drive out the inefficiencies, really.",

I do think there is more of an element of people wanting to know where it’s come from. And I think there is an element of people wanting that, but it’s how you get the price and the customers to stop undermining everything we’re doing in the UK, in the food industry. Because customers are willing to pay for it. They’re willing to pay for quality.

And that, as an industry, as a country, for food manufacturing areas we need to clamp down on.\nI’m wondering if Brexit is a factor? If it’s harder to import things, would that be in your favour?\nWell, it’s harder to import things, definitely. But as a country we haven’t got enough manufacturers to process the potatoes we have in the country anyway. So, we’ve let it all go abroad, potatoes go to Belgium and then come back ready-made.\nBut that might be more difficult.

We’re just flooding the market.\nDo you think that [org name] could actually, in any way, contribute towards helping with developing this processing capacity?\nWe could, but the trouble with all these ideas is that they cost a lot of money. And at a farm level, there isn’t a lot of money left in the tank to be able to chuck at these things. You’ve got to make your profits to then reinvest them. And the banking industry is backing away from agriculture, because it’s not seen as a very well – the profit margins are pathetic. So, it’s building that to go forward. Money is key. Just like a chicken and egg scenario, isn’t it?\nYes. So, you’re aware of this issue but you might not be in a position personally to do much about it?\nExactly. I can see the issue.

        "query": "And then of course, there is the COVID crisis on top of this. So, perhaps just considering that in particular, how did COVID impact you as an organisation?\n[org name], as an organisation, we had contracts – our customers basically tore up in front of us. For supply, we’ve basically not been able to move the tonnage required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped. And I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector. So, all of a sudden, we had a lot of potatoes sat there with no homes. That was a major effect. To the point after the lockdown now, this sector doesn’t require the potatoes. And we’re planning now for 2021/2022 harvest and to be quite honest we’ve got customers who won’t sign a contract with us until they know more about what is going to happen. But as a farmer, you have to buy the seed, you have to plant the potatoes, you can’t stop. But the customers are just saying, ‘Well, not sure. Plant them – I’ll let you know later in the year whether we’re going to take them or not.’\nAre you fearing you might end up with a pile of potatoes you can’t sell to anybody?\nAbsolutely. Thousands of tonnes of potatoes in the ground and in sheds which will not get processed or used. They’ll just get wasted.\nI wonder if the Direct to Customer service could help here? If you could get some straight to the customers, would that help?\nThere is an element of that, but there are a lot of people who don’t use potatoes – the cooking at home is rice, it’s pasta. Certainly, don’t want to be importing stuff, which is what’s coming up. So, if you want to help the British farmers, the supermarkets, the factories need to stop importing stuff.\nAnd start taking things from British suppliers. So, is [org name] a suitable venue to publicise this, to actually say, ‘Look, we’ve got all this stuff, you don’t need to go abroad’?\nWell, it is, but we’re probably not a big enough player. When you’re talking to the likes of McCain’s, and Walkers, and those sorts of people, they’re a multinational company anyway, they have suppliers from all over the place. It’s got to come from government level really, to say, ‘No, no more.’ Or the supermarkets, the customers. But it’s not the public, it is the supermarkets. And the government has got to say, ‘No, enough is enough.’\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID? Anything at all?\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes – that side of things has done very well on the back of it. So, that’s something, that’s good. But it’s not to the same scale as what we’ve lost on the other side.\nAnd I think you’ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\nSo, you’re not going to go quite back to the way you were before? It’s going to be different?\nIt’ll certainly be different.\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\nYeah, it’s killing agriculture big style. If all the manufacturers stop, it’ll kill it.\nAnd that’s all very worrying. Well, I hope things get better for you. I’ve come to the end of my questions now, you’ve shed a lot of insight into what’s sort of happening in this situation. I wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\nWhat’s the idea – obviously you’re asking other people within the industry – what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\nWe’ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that. Find out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems – and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\nYeah. I think there are two-three solutions to the problem. One, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses – that’s a must in every sector we go to. I think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back. And these food miles are absolutely nuts. It’s mad. And yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we’re doing. We’ll have no business left. The banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\nWithout food there isn’t much else, is there really?\nNot really! We’ve got the retail side but that’s upside down. But I’m not saying free money, far from it, I don’t want any subsidies, we’ve got to stand for ourselves. We need to be able survive and we need to be competitive.\nSo, what you’re looking for is appropriate investment?\nYes. And the government-backed loans for the right…it’s like a chicken-and-egg – you can’t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot. Put it to them – to do what you want and what you say you’re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\nThat seems very clear. As we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay. So, there’s more money coming back to the farm.",

We’re just flooding the market. This statement underscores the pressing issue of inadequate processing capacity in the UK agricultural sector, which has been exacerbated by recent challenges such as Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. The speaker is concerned that without sufficient processing facilities, the hard work of farmers will not translate into marketable products, leading to waste and financial instability. This reflects a broader call for investment in local processing capabilities to ensure that farmers can effectively bring their produce to market and sustain their livelihoods."

They argue that there is an urgent need to clamp down on practices that undermine the local agricultural economy, suggesting that without intervention, the sustainability of the industry is at risk. This statement reflects a broader concern about the need for a more resilient food system that prioritizes local sourcing and fair pricing for farmers, especially in the wake of disruptions caused by external factors like Brexit and the pandemic."
