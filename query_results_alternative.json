If we don\u2019t have sustainability, we\u2019ve got problems. I want to bring more farmers on board, to grow our members; to see the benefits of what we\u2019re doing. And also, to look at taking this \u2013 we\u2019ve just started off a 7.5kg bag line, it\u2019s a new thing for us, getting closer to the customer, and I think we\u2019ll look at something else to get closer to the customer really and cut the factories out, where we become further down the chain. The closer to the customer we get, the more we\u2019ll get back to the farm.\nSo, ultimately you would have a process that would take the produce directly from the farm, straight to the end customer?\nThat is the ultimate. I think rather than just selling the potato, we\u2019ll slice it, and things like that. Or we\u2019ll put it into ready-made meals. Well maybe not that, but get it ready to go closer to the end user.\nSo, you\u2019re sort of gradually, as you mentioned, bypassing elements of the chain, starting recently with going direct to consumer and that\u2019s the direction you want to take in the future?\nI think one thing is the scale, we need to increase the volumes we trade as a group. And on the other side we need an avenue where we get closer to the customer, to take the volatility out of the job.\nAnd how do you feel this will contribute to sustainability?\nBecause you\u2019ve got [unclear] contracts in front of you. The factories, the customers \u2013 to be honest, the customers are quite happy paying a fair price for a good quality product. The problem is market prices \u2013 these dealers in the middle, and the factories, are really, when they can do, dropping the price for the farmers. So, we need to move closer to the end product where we can sustain a steady, average price for sustainability. Because in the last two years, we\u2019ve seen the base price collapse to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne. And to give you an idea, we need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs, to break even.\nAnd so, you can charge a fair price to the end customer whilst still getting enough profit to stay in business?\nYes.\nRight, good.\nSo, we need to get close to then cut those rogues out the industry, really.\nOkay, so it\u2019s cutting the rogues out. So, it sounds like you\u2019ve already taken the next step towards doing that by starting a direct-to-customer service?\nYeah, that was done \u2013 we launched about four months\u2019 ago.\nAnd this is basically the direction you\u2019re going in, to expand that part of the business?\nIt\u2019s part of it yes. Obviously, there are different areas. We want more growers on board, more customers, and to grow that base we\u2019d need to add more of what we\u2019re doing and probably streamline what we\u2019re doing.

The closer to the customer we get, the more we\u2019ll get back to the farm.

This approach is intended to create a more direct supply chain, ultimately allowing for a process that delivers produce straight from the farm to the end customer. By doing so, they hope to enhance profitability for farmers and ensure that the financial benefits of their work are maximized."

For supply, we\u2019ve basically not been able to move the tonnage required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped. And I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector. So, all of a sudden, we had a lot of potatoes sat there with no homes. That was a major effect. To the point after the lockdown now, this sector doesn\u2019t require the potatoes. And we\u2019re planning now for 2021/2022 harvest and to be quite honest we\u2019ve got customers who won\u2019t sign a contract with us until they know more about what is going to happen. But as a farmer, you have to buy the seed, you have to plant the potatoes, you can\u2019t stop. But the customers are just saying, \u2018Well, not sure. Plant them \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know later in the year whether we\u2019re going to take them or not.\u2019\nAre you fearing you might end up with a pile of potatoes you can\u2019t sell to anybody?\nAbsolutely. Thousands of tonnes of potatoes in the ground and in sheds which will not get processed or used. They\u2019ll just get wasted.\nI wonder if the Direct to Customer service could help here? If you could get some straight to the customers, would that help?\nThere is an element of that, but there are a lot of people who don\u2019t use potatoes \u2013 the cooking at home is rice, it\u2019s pasta. Certainly, don\u2019t want to be importing stuff, which is what\u2019s coming up. So, if you want to help the British farmers, the supermarkets, the factories need to stop importing stuff.\nAnd start taking things from British suppliers. So, is [org name] a suitable venue to publicise this, to actually say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got all this stuff, you don\u2019t need to go abroad\u2019?\nWell, it is, but we\u2019re probably not a big enough player. When you\u2019re talking to the likes of McCain\u2019s, and Walkers, and those sorts of people, they\u2019re a multinational company anyway, they have suppliers from all over the place. It\u2019s got to come from government level really, to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019 Or the supermarkets, the customers. But it\u2019s not the public, it is the supermarkets. And the government has got to say, \u2018No, enough is enough.\u2019\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID? Anything at all?\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes \u2013 that side of things has done very well on the back of it. So, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s good. But it\u2019s not to the same scale as what we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\nSo, you\u2019re not going to go quite back to the way you were before? It\u2019s going to be different?\nIt\u2019ll certainly be different.\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\nYeah, it\u2019s killing agriculture big style. If all the manufacturers stop, it\u2019ll kill it.\nAnd that\u2019s all very worrying. Well, I hope things get better for you. I\u2019ve come to the end of my questions now, you\u2019ve shed a lot of insight into what\u2019s sort of happening in this situation. I wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\nWe\u2019ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that. Find out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\nYeah. I think there are two-three solutions to the problem. One, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to. I think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back. And these food miles are absolutely nuts. It\u2019s mad. And yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ll have no business left. The banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really! We\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down. But I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves. We need to be able survive and we need to be competitive.\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\nYes. And the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot. Put it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\nThat seems very clear. As we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay. So, there\u2019s more money coming back to the farm.",
