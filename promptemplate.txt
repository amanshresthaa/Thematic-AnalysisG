Task: Select quotations that align with the research objectives and theoretical framework while following these criteria:

For each quotation, provide:

1. quote_data:
{
    "quote": str,                    # The exact quotation text
    "context": str,                  # Surrounding context from interview
    "type": str,                     # 'discrete' (brief diverse perspectives)
                                    # 'embedded' (transition phrases) 
                                    # 'longer' (complex understanding)
    "function": str,                 # 'evidence' | 'explanation' | 'illustration' | 
                                    # 'impression' | 'representation'
    "pattern_strength": float,       # 0.0-1.0 indicating robustness of pattern
    "theoretical_alignment": float   # 0.0-1.0 alignment with framework
}

2. analysis:
{
    "selection_rationale": str,     # Why this quote was chosen 
    "theoretical_relevance": str,   # How quote supports theoretical framework
    "objective_support": str,       # How quote advances research objectives
    "patterns": str                 # Key patterns identified
}

Key Guidelines:
1. Focus on relevance to research objectives
2. Ensure theoretical alignment
3. Provide adequate context
4. Identify clear patterns
5. Maintain participant confidentiality
6. Balance diversity of perspectives

Return response as valid JSON with 'quotations' and 'analysis' fields.
