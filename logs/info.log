***
and I encourage people to be aligned with that ready to go [Music] hello everyone welcome to open AI Dev day
***
I am Harry stebbings of 20 VC and I am very very excited to interview
***
Sam ultman welcome Sam Sam thank you for letting me do this today with you thanks for doing now we have many many questions from the audience
***
and so I wanted to start with one when we look forward is the future of open AI more models like A1 or is it more larger models that we would maybe have expected of old how do we think about that
***
I mean we want to make things better across the board but this direction of reasoning models is of particular importance to us
***
I think reasoning will unlock I hope reason will unlock a lot of the things that we've been waiting years to do and the the ability for models like this is to for example contribute to new science uh help write a lot more very difficult code uh that I think can drive things forward to a significant degree
***
so you should expect rapid Improvement in the O Series of models and it's of great strategic importance to us another one that I thought was really important for us to touch on was when we look forward to open ai's future plans how do you think about developing no code tools for non-technical Founders to build and scale AI apps how do you think about that it'll get there for sure uh I I think the the first step will be tools that make people who know how to code well more productive
***
but eventually I think we can offer really high quality no code tools and already there's some out there that makes sense
***
but you can't you can't sort of in a no code way say I have like a full startup I want to build um that's going to take a while
***
so when we look at where we are in the stack today open AI sits in a certain place how far up the stack is open AI going go
***
I think it's a brilliant question but if you're spending a lot of time tuning your rag system is this a waste of time because open AI ultimately thinks I'll own this part of the application layer or is it not and how do you answer a Founder who has that question the general answer we try to give is we are going to try our hardest and believe we will succeed at making our models better and better and better and if you are building a business that patches some current small shortcomings if we do our job right then that will not be as important in the future if on the other hand you build a company that benefits from the model getting better and better if you know an oracle told you today that 04 was going to be just absolutely incredible and do all of these things that right now feel impossible and you were happy about that
***
then you know maybe we're wrong but at least that's what we're going for and if instead you say okay there's this area where there are many but you pick one of the many areas where 01 preview underperforms and say I'm going to patch this and just barely get it to work then you're sort of assuming that the next turn of the model crank won't be as good as we think it will be and that is the general philosophical message we try to get out to startups like we we believe that we are on a pretty a quite steep trajectory of improvement and that the current shortcomings of the models today um will just be taken care of by Future generations
***
and you know I encourage people to be aligned with that we did an interview before with Brad and sorry it's not quite on schedule
***
but I think the show has always been successful when we kind of go a little bit off schedule there was this brilliant'.

and I think we'll see many other examples like that we I mentioned earlier like healthcare and education but those are two that are both like trillions of dollars of value to the world to get right if you and if AI can really really truly enable this to happen in a different way than it has before I don't think big numbers are the point and they're also the debate about whether it's 9 trillion or 1 trillion or whatever like you know I don't smarter people than me it takes to figure that out

but but the value creation does seem just unbelievable here we're going to get to agents in terms of kind of how that values delivered in terms of like the delivery mechan mechanism for which it's valued open source is an incredibly prominent method through which it could be how do you think about the role of Open Source in the future of AI and how does internal discussions look like for you when the question comes should we open source any models or some models there there's clearly a really important place in the Eos system for open source models there's also really good open source models that now exist um I think there's also a place for like nicely offered well integrated services and apis

and you know I think it's I think it makes sense that all of this stuff is an offer and people will pick what what works for them as a delivery mechanism we have the open source as of kind of enop to customers and a way to deliver that we can have agents I think there's a lot of uh kind of semantic confusion around what an agent is how do you think about the definition of Agents today and what is an agent to you and what is it not this is like my off-the-cuff answer it's not well considered

but something that I can give a long duration task to and provide minimal supervision during execution for what do you think people think about agents that actually they get wrong

well it's more like I don't I don't think any of us yet have an intuition for what this is going to be like you know we're all gesturing at something that seems important maybe I can give the following example when people talk about an AI agent acting on their behalf uh the the main example they seem to give fairly consistant is oh you can like ask the agent to go book you a restaurant reservation um and either it can like use open table or it can like call the restaurant

okay sure that's that's like a mild Le annoying thing to have to do
***
and it maybe like saves you some work one of the things that I think is interesting as a world where uh you can just do things that you wouldn't or couldn't do as a human so what if what if instead of calling uh one restaurant to make a reservation my agent would call me like 300 and figure out which one had the best food for me or some special thing available or whatever and then you would say well that's like really annoying if your agent is calling 300 restaurants but if if it's an agent answering each of those 300 300 places then no problem and it can be this like massively parallel thing that a human can't do so that's like a trivial example but there are these like limitations to human bandwidth that maybe these agents won't have the category I think though is more interesting is not the one that people normally talk about where you have this thing calling restaurants for you but something that's more like a really smart senior co-worker um where you can like collaborate on a project with and the agent can go do like a two-day task or two week task'.

***
but we really have no idea I mean I could imagine a world where you can say like I want one GPU or 10 gpus or 100 gpus to just be like turning on my problems all the time and it's not like you're not like paying per seat or even per agent but you're like it's priced based off the amount of compute that's like working on a you know on your problems all the time do we need to build specific models for agentic use or do we not how do you think about that there's a huge amount of infrastructure and Scaffolding to build for sure
***
but I think 01 points the way to a model that is capable of doing great agentic tasks on the model side Sam everyone says that uh models are depreciating assets the commoditization of models is so Rife how do you respond and think about that and when you think about the increasing Capital intensity to train models are we actually seeing the reversion of that where it requires so much money that actually very few people can do it
***
it's definitely true that there are depreciating assets um this thing that they're not though worth as much as they cost to train that seems totally wrong um to say nothing of the fact that there's like a there's a positive compounding effect as you learn to train these models you get better at training the next one
***
but the actual like Revenue we can make from a model I think justifies the investment to be fair
***
uh I don't think that's true for everyone and there's a lot of there are probably too many people training very similar models and if you're a little behind or if you don't have a product with the sort of normal rules of business that make that product sticky and valuable
***
then
***
yeah maybe you can't maybe it's harder to get a return on the investment we're very fortunate to have chat GPT and hundreds of millions of people that use our models and so even if it cost a lot we get to like amortize that cost across a lot of people how do you think about how open AI models continue to differentiate over time and where you most want to focus to expand that differentiation reasoning is our current most important area of focus I think this is what unlocks the next like massive Leap Forward in in value created so that's we'll improve them in lots of ways uh we will do multimodal work uh we will do other features in the models that we think are super important to the ways that people want to use these things how do you think about reasoning in multimodal work like there the challenges what you want to achieve love to understand that reasoning in multimodality

spe
***
yeah
***
I hope it's just going to work
***
I mean it obviously takes some doing to get done
***
but uh you know like people like when they're babies and toddlers before they're good at language can still do quite complex visual reasoning so clearly this is possible totally is um how will Vision capabilities scale with new inference time Paradigm set by 01 without spoiling anything I would expect rapid progress in image based models going off schedule is one thing trying to tease that out might get me in real trouble how does open AI make breakthroughs in terms of like core reasoning do we need to start pushing into reinforcement learning as a pathway or other new techniques aside from the Transformer I mean there's two questions in there there's how we do it'.

but we really have no idea I mean I could imagine a world where you can say like I want one GPU or 10 gpus or 100 gpus to just be like turning on my problems all the time and it's not like you're not like paying per seat or even per agent but you're like it's priced based off the amount of compute that's like working on a you know on your problems all the time do we need to build specific models for agentic use or do we not how do you think about that there's a huge amount of infrastructure and Scaffolding to build for sure
***
but I think 01 points the way to a model that is capable of doing great agentic tasks on the model side Sam everyone says that uh models are depreciating assets the commoditization of models is so Rife how do you respond and think about that and when you think about the increasing Capital intensity to train models are we actually seeing the reversion of that where it requires so much money that actually very few people can do it
***
it's definitely true that there are depreciating assets um this thing that they're not though worth as much as they cost to train that seems totally wrong um to say nothing of the fact that there's like a there's a positive compounding effect as you learn to train these models you get better at training the next one
***
but the actual like Revenue we can make from a model I think justifies the investment to be fair
***
uh I don't think that's true for everyone and there's a lot of there are probably too many people training very similar models and if you're a little behind or if you don't have a product with the sort of normal rules of business that make that product sticky and valuable
***
then
***
yeah maybe you can't maybe it's harder to get a return on the investment we're very fortunate to have chat GPT and hundreds of millions of people that use our models and so even if it cost a lot we get to like amortize that cost across a lot of people how do you think about how open AI models continue to differentiate over time and where you most want to focus to expand that differentiation reasoning is our current most important area of focus I think this is what unlocks the next like massive Leap Forward in in value created so that's we'll improve them in lots of ways uh we will do multimodal work uh we will do other features in the models that we think are super important to the ways that people want to use these things how do you think about reasoning in multimodal work like there the challenges what you want to achieve love to understand that reasoning in multimodality
***
spe
***
yeah
***
I hope it's just going to work
***
I mean it obviously takes some doing to get done
***
but uh you know like people like when they're babies and toddlers before they're good at language can still do quite complex visual reasoning so clearly this is possible totally is um how will Vision capabilities scale with new inference time Paradigm set by 01 without spoiling anything I would expect rapid progress in image based models going off schedule is one thing trying to tease that out might get me in real trouble how does open AI make breakthroughs in terms of like core reasoning do we need to start pushing into reinforcement learning as a pathway or other new techniques aside from the Transformer I mean there's two questions in there there's how we do it': [interview_001_chunk_1, interview_001_chunk_3, interview_001_chunk_0, interview_001_chunk_2, interview_001_chunk_4]

it's I say easy

but it's doable to go off and copy it

and I'm sure you'll see this in replications of 01 what is really hard and the thing that I'm most proud of about our culture is the repeated ability to go off and do something new and totally unproven and a lot of organizations
***
not I'm not not talking about AI research just generally a lot of organizations talk about the ability to do this there are very few that do um across any field and in some sense I think this is one of the most important inputs to human progress so one of the like retirement things I fantasize about doing is writing a book of everything I've learned about how to build an organization and a culture that does this thing not the organization that just copies what everybody else has done because I think this is something that the world could have a lot more of it's limited by human talent but there's a huge amount of wasted human talent because this is not an organization style or culture whatever you want to call it that we are all good at building
***
so I'd love way more of that and that is I think the thing most special about us
***
Sam how is human Talent wasted oh there's just a lot of really talented people in the world that are not working to their full potential um because they work at a Bad Company or they live in a country that doesn't support any good companies uh or a long list of other things I mean the one of the things I'm most excited about with AI is I hope it'll get us much better than we are now at helping get everyone to their Max potential which we are nowhere nowhere near there's a lot of people in the world that I'm sure would be phenomenal AI researchers had their life paths just gone a little bit differently you've had an incredible journey over the last few years through you know unbelievable hyper growth you say about writing a book there in retirement if you reflect back on the 10 years of leadership change that you've undergone how have you changed your leadership most significantly I think the thing that has been most unusual for me about these last couple of years is just the rate at which things have changed at a normal company you get time to go from zero to 100 million in Revenue 100 million to a billion billion to 10 billion you don't have to do that in like a two-year period and you don't have to like build the company we had to research that
***
but we really didn't have a company in the sense of a traditional Silicon Valley startup that's you know scaling and serving lots of customers whatever um having to do that so quickly there was just like a lot of stuff that I was supposed to get more time to learn than I got what did you not know that you would have liked more time to learn I mean I would say like what did I know one of the things that just came to mind out of like a rolling list of a hundred is how hard it is how much active work it takes to get the company to focus not on how you grow the next 10% but the next 10x and growing the next 10% it's the same things that worked before will work again but to go from a company doing say like a billion to1 billion dollars in Revenue requires a whole lot of change and it is not the sort of like let's do last week what we did this week mindset and in a world where people don't get time to even get caught up on the basics because growth is just so rapid'.

I I think developers use multiple models most of the time and I'm not sure how that's all going to evolve as we head towards this more AG genified World um

but I sort of think there's just going to be a lot of AI everywhere and something about the way that we currently talk about it or think about it feels wrong uh may maybe if I had to describe it we will shift from talking about models to talking about systems but that'll take a while when we think about scaling models how many more model iterations do you think scaling laws will hold true for it was the kind of common refrain that it won't last for long

and it seems to be proving to last longer than people think without going into detail about how it's going to happen the the the core of the question that you're getting at is is the trajectory of model capability Improvement going to keep going like it has has been going and the answer that I believe is yes for a long time have you ever doubted that totally why uh we have had well we've had like Behavior we don't understand we've had failed training runs we all sorts of things we've had to figure out new paradigms when we kind of get to towards the end of one and have to figure out the next what was the hardest one to navigate well when we started working on gp4 there were some issues that caused us a lot of consternation that we really didn't know how to solve we figured it out

but there was there was definitely a time period where we just didn't know how we were going to do that model and then in this shift to 01 and the idea of reasoning models uh that was something we had been excited about for a long time

but it was like a long and Winding Road of research to get here is it difficult to maintain morale when it is long and winding roads when training runs can fail how do you maintain morale in those times you know we have a lot of people here who are excited to build AGI and that that's a very motivating thing

***
and you don't say oh this is a transistor product it's just like
***
oh all right this thing can like process information for me you don't even really think about that it's just expected Sam i' love to do a quick fire round with you
***
so I'm going to say so I'm going to say a short statement you give me your immediate thoughts
***
okay
***
okay
***
so you are building today as a whatever 23 24 year old with the infrastructure that we have today what do you choose to build if you started today uh some AI enabled vertical
***
I'll I 'll I'll use tutors as an example but like the the the best AI tutoring product or the you know that I could possibly imagine to teach people to learn any category like that could be the AI lawyer could be the sort of like AI CAD engineer whatever you mentioned your book if you were to write a book what would you call it I don't have a title ready I haven't thought about this book other than like I wish something existed because I think it could unlock a lot of human potential
***
so maybe I think it would be something about human potential what in AI does no one focus on that everyone should spend more time on what I would love to see there's a lot of different ways to solve this problem but something about an AI that can understand your whole life doesn't have to like literally be infinite context but some way that you can have an AI agent that like knows everything there is to know about you has access to all of your data things like that what was one thing that surprised you in the last month
***
Sam it's a research result I can't talk about but it is breathtakingly good which competitor do you most respect why them
***
I mean I kind of respect everybody in the space right now I think there's like really amazing work coming from the whole field and Incredibly talented incredibly hardworking people I don't mean this to be a question Dodge
***
it's like I can point to super talented people doing super great work everywhere in the field is that one not really uh tell me what's your favorite open AI API I think the new realtime API is pretty awesome
***
but we have a lot of I mean we have a we have a big API business at this point so there's a lot of good stuff in there who do you most respect in AI today Sam uh let me give a shout out to the cursor team I mean there's a lot of people doing incredible work in AI
***
but I think to really have do what they've done and built I thought about like a bunch of researchers I could name um but in terms of using AI to deliver a really magical experience that creates a lot of value in a way that people just didn't quite manage to put the pieces together
***

but if you're trying to build the AI itself that's pretty different another example people uses electricity um which I think doesn't make sense for a ton of reasons the one I like the most caveat by my earlier comment that I don't think people should be doing this or trying to like use these analogies too seriously is the transistor it was a new discovery of physics it had incredible scaling properties it seeped everywhere pretty quickly you know we had things like Moors law in a way that we could now imagine like a bunch of laws for AI that tell us something about how quickly it's going to get better um and everyone kind of B like the whole tech industry kind of benefited from it and there's a lot of transistors involved in the products and delivery of services that you use but you don't really think of them as transistor companies um it's there's a very complex very expensive industrial process around it with a massive supply chain and incredible progress based off of this very simple discovery of physics led to this gigantic uplift of the whole economy for a long time even though most of the time you didn't think about it
***
and you don't say oh this is a transistor product it's just like
***
oh all right this thing can like process information for me you don't even really think about that it's just expected Sam i' love to do a quick fire round with you
***
so I'm going to say so I'm going to say a short statement you give me your immediate thoughts
***
okay
***
okay
***
so you are building today as a whatever 23 24 year old with the infrastructure that we have today what do you choose to build if you started today uh some AI enabled vertical
***
I'll I 'll I'll use tutors as an example but like the the the best AI tutoring product or the you know that I could possibly imagine to teach people to learn any category like that could be the AI lawyer could be the sort of like AI CAD engineer whatever you mentioned your book if you were to write a book what would you call it I don't have a title ready I haven't thought about this book other than like I wish something existed because I think it could unlock a lot of human potential
***
so maybe I think it would be something about human potential what in AI does no one focus on that everyone should spend more time on what I would love to see there's a lot of different ways to solve this problem but something about an AI that can understand your whole life doesn't have to like literally be infinite context but some way that you can have an AI agent that like knows everything there is to know about you has access to all of your data things like that what was one thing that surprised you in the last month
***
Sam it's a research result I can't talk about but it is breathtakingly good which competitor do you most respect why them
***
I mean I kind of respect everybody in the space right now I think there's like really amazing work coming from the whole field and Incredibly talented incredibly hardworking people I don't mean this to be a question Dodge
***
it's like I can point to super talented people doing super great work everywhere in the field is that one not really uh tell me what's your favorite open AI API I think the new realtime API is pretty awesome
***
but we have a lot of I mean we have a we have a big API business at this point so there's a lot of good stuff in there who do you most respect in AI today Sam uh let me give a shout out to the cursor team I mean there's a lot of people doing incredible work in AI
***
but I think to really have do what they've done and built I thought about like a bunch of researchers I could name um but in terms of using AI to deliver a really magical experience that creates a lot of value in a way that people just didn't quite manage to put the pieces together
***
I think that's it's really quite remarkable

and I'm not even going that quick

but I'm you know trying not to think for multiple minutes uh in this context latency is what you want if you

but if you were like hey Sam

I want you to go like make a new important Discovery in physics you'd probably be happy to wait a couple of years and the answer is it should be user controllable

can I ask when you think about insecurity and Leadership I think it's something that everyone has uh it's something we don't often talk about um when you think about maybe an insecurity and Leadership an area of your leadership that you'd like to improve where would you most like to improve as a leader and a CEO to today the thing I'm struggling with most this week is I feel more uncertain than I have in the past about what our like the details of what our product strategy should be um I think that product is a weakness of mine in general
***
um and it's something that right now the company like needs stronger and clearer vision on from me like we have a wonderful head of product and a great product team
***
but it's an area that I wish I were a lot stronger on and acutely feeling the the miss right now you hired Kevin um I've known Kevin for years he's exceptional Kevin's amazing what makes Kevin worldclass as a product leader to you discipline was the first word that came to mind huh in terms of focus focus what we're going to say no to like really trying to speak on behalf of the user about why we would do something or not do something like really trying to be rigorous about not not having like Fantastical dreams we have a 5year horizon for open Ai and a 10e if you have a magic wand and can paint that scenario for the 5 year in a 10 year can you paint that canvas for me for the five and 10 year I mean I can easily do it for like the next two years but if we are right and we start to make systems that are so good at you know for example helping us with scientific advancement
***
actually I I will just say it
***
I think in five years it looks like we have an unbelievably rapid rate of improvement in technology itself you know people are like man the AGI moment came and went whatever the like the the pace of progress is like totally crazy and we're discovering all this new stuff both about AI research and also about all of the rest of Science and that feels like if we could sit here now and look at it it would seem like it should be very crazy and then the second part of the prediction is that Society itself actually changes surprisingly little an example of this would be that I think if you asked people five years ago if computers were going to pass the tering test they would say no
***
and then if you said well what if an oracle told you it was going to they would say well it would somehow be like just this crazy breathtaking change for society and we did kind of satisfy the Turning test roughly speaking of course and Society didn't change that much it just sort of went whooshing by and that's kind of a example of what I expect to keep happening which is progress scientific progress keeps going outperforming all expectations and Society in a way that I think is good and healthy um changes not that much in the long term it will hugely change five or 10 you've been amazing
***
I had this list of questions I I didn't really state to them uh thank you for putting up with my Meandering around different questions thank you everyone for coming I'm so thrilled that we were able to do this today and
