I'm Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens JMP.

It's a pleasure to have Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs with me today.
***
Ripple is one of the largest and most successful companies in the digital asset space.
***
And the goal here today is really, to help educate our institutional clients on Ripple's business model, the opportunity going forward, and then also gain some perspective on, what's going on in the industry and where we're evolving to.
***
Obviously, I think a lot of talk lot to talk about in there.
***
So, Brad, first off, great to see you.
***
I know you're a busy man these days, and there's a lot going on.
***
But, you know, we're about 1 month post election here.
***
You can kinda feel the optimism building in the room, and and I think there's a lot to get into around that.
***
But but, really, maybe, I think the best place to start is your journey, to Ripple in 2015.
***
You know, you you came to Ripple well before, I think the company was a household name well before people really understood blockchain technology and that move moving into the mainstream.
***
So I'd love to just get that perspective first, and I think we have a lot, to catch up on.
***
Yeah.
***
I appreciate it.
***
Well, thanks for thanks for having me.
***
There is a lot going on, and I agree with your earlier comment of, you know, it, very good and kinda post election world.
***
So I I first was exposed to Bitcoin actually in 2012.
***
Peter Thiel and a guy named Orin Hoffman run an annual conference called Dialog.
***
I think it happens twice a year now, but, and there was a session on Bitcoin.
***
I'd never heard of it and, participated with some of my friends.
***
You know, this Dialog is not really you're not really spoken at, but kind of small groups.
***
And I don't remember who the advocate was.
***
It might have been Mickey Malka, but, talking about Bitcoin.
***
And at the time, I was doing some angel investing, and so I kind of treated it as, okay.
***
You know, it might go to 0.
***
It's something better.
***
I I, frankly, I always worried that the Achilles' heel of Bitcoin might be this kind of anti bank, anti government sentiment.
***
And, you know, it's just to me, it limited the market opportunity if you're gonna take a a that approach because I feel like governments aren't gonna go away, banks aren't gonna go away in my opinion.
***
So years later, a recruiter actually called me and introduced me to Ripple.
***
And what resonated with me right out of the gates was this idea of how do we work with the legacy infrastructure, what we now would call TradFi.
***
And, you know, that included government and certainly banks, and it it resonated with me that Ripple is trying to work with the system rather than, create a fully new system.
***
There's obviously, you know, arguments on both sides of that.
***
I can see those arguments.
***
But, from the very earliest days, Ripple's kinda taken approach of we're going to be a bridge between decentralized finance and traditional finance and, bring products to market to help help bridge those both, frankly, culturally, technologically, etcetera.
***
So that's that's how my journey began.
***
As you pointed out, I joined in 2015, through, you know, a little luck, a little skill.
***
We find ourselves in a really compelling place with a bunch of customers and, you know, scaling products.
***
So we're pretty pleased about that.
***
So talk a little bit about the the business journey of Ripple itself.'.
