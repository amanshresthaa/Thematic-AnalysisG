The market demand showed us there was a gap for locally-grown herbs, especially for restaurants and specialty markets.\nAnd this is all through the cooperative structure?\nYes, we found that by working together we could better manage distribution and get better prices.

The speaker expresses concern about the potential for thousands of tonnes of unsold potatoes due to the sudden halt in demand from restaurants and similar businesses. By suggesting that the Direct to Customer service could help, the speaker is considering innovative ways to reach consumers directly, thereby potentially reducing the surplus and ensuring that the produce is utilized effectively. This reflects a broader strategy to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer behaviors in the wake of the pandemic."
