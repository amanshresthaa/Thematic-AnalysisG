This innovative model not only aims to enhance the financial stability of the farmers but also seeks to create a more sustainable food system. The organization is actively managing the supply of potatoes from multiple farms, ensuring a steady flow to factories and consumers alike. Their recent initiatives, such as launching a direct-to-consumer service, reflect a strategic move towards reducing reliance on larger processing firms and fostering a closer connection with end-users.
