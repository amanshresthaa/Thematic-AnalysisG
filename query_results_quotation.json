Since we can't use synthetic pesticides, we rely heavily on natural methods like crop rotation and beneficial insects. Another challenge is soil health - maintaining fertile soil without chemical fertilizers requires a lot of effort and knowledge.\nHow do you manage these challenges?\nWe've invested in training our farmers on sustainable practices. We also work closely with agricultural universities to test new methods. For soil health, we use cover crops and composting to enrich the soil naturally.\nAre there any technological solutions you're exploring?\nYes, we're experimenting with precision agriculture tools that use sensors and data analytics to optimize water and nutrient use. It's still early, but we hope it will help us reduce waste and improve yields.",

Additionally, we're working on reducing our operational costs through better resource management.\nDo you see any threats to the organic market?\nYes, one major threat is the rise of 'fake organic' products.
