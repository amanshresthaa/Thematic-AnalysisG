The market demand showed us there was a gap for locally-grown herbs, especially for restaurants and specialty markets.\nAnd this is all through the cooperative structure?\nYes, we found that by working together we could better manage distribution and get better prices.

By doing so, they ensure that the profits from potato sales are returned directly to the farmers, rather than being siphoned off by intermediaries. This approach not only supports the financial stability of the farmers but also aims to create a more sustainable and equitable food system. The speaker notes that this model is a response to the historical lack of profitability for farmers, and they are committed to changing that dynamic by directly managing the supply and marketing of their produce."
