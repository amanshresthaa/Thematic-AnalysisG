Initially we were just growing carrots and parsnips, but we've expanded into leafy greens and specialty herbs.\nSo you've diversified your crop portfolio?\nYes, exactly. The market demand showed us there was a gap for locally-grown herbs, especially for restaurants and specialty markets.\nAnd this is all through the cooperative structure?\nYes, we found that by working together we could better manage distribution and get better prices.
