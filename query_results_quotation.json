Since we can't use synthetic pesticides, we rely heavily on natural methods like crop rotation and beneficial insects. Another challenge is soil health - maintaining fertile soil without chemical fertilizers requires a lot of effort and knowledge. How do you manage these challenges? We've invested in training our farmers on sustainable practices. We also work closely with agricultural universities to test new methods. For soil health, we use cover crops and composting to enrich the soil naturally. Are there any technological solutions you're exploring? Yes, we're experimenting with precision agriculture tools that use sensors and data analytics to optimize water and nutrient use. It's still early, but we hope it will help us reduce waste and improve yields.",

Additionally, we're working on reducing our operational costs through better resource management. Do you see any threats to the organic market? Yes, one major threat is the rise of 'fake organic' products. Some companies label their products as organic without proper certification, which can mislead consumers.

The factories, the customers \u2013 to be honest, the customers are quite happy paying a fair price for a good quality product. The problem is market prices \u2013 these dealers in the middle, and the factories, are really, when they can do, dropping the price for the farmers. So, we need to move closer to the end product where we can sustain a steady, average price for sustainability. Because in the last two years, we\u2019ve seen the base price collapse to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne. And to give you an idea, we need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs, to break even. And so, you can charge a fair price to the end customer whilst still getting enough profit to stay in business?",

They note that while customers are willing to pay a fair price for quality, the market is currently skewed by middlemen and factories that drive prices down, making it difficult for farmers to break even. The speaker emphasizes the need to move closer to the end product to stabilize prices, as they have experienced a significant drop in base prices over the past two years. They assert that to cover costs, farmers need to receive \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne, contrasting sharply with the current market prices of \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne. This situation underscores the importance of restructuring the supply chain to ensure that farmers can charge fair prices while remaining profitable."
