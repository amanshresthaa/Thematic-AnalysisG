  "research_objectives": "To analyze and evaluate the role of diplomatic rhetoric and public discourse in shaping international conflict resolution, with a focus on high-stakes political exchanges. The study examines how leaders’ assertions of national alignment and personal diplomacy influence negotiation outcomes and media narratives.",
  "theoretical_framework": {
    "theory": "This research is grounded in political communication theory, discourse analysis, and international relations theory. It integrates concepts from rhetorical strategy and signaling theory to investigate how public statements and televised debates reflect broader geopolitical strategies, identity construction, and power dynamics.",
    "philosophical_approach": "Adopting an interpretivist and constructivist stance, the study emphasizes qualitative examination of language, performance, and media framing. It leverages case studies and content analysis to uncover the underlying narratives that inform both domestic and international perceptions of diplomatic engagement.",
    "rationale": "The rationale is to address the gap in understanding how diplomatic language and public debate, as seen in high-profile confrontations, impact the strategic environment. By dissecting contentious exchanges—such as the Trump–Zelensky dialogue—the research seeks to provide insights into the mechanisms through which national interests, personal rhetoric, and media dynamics interact to influence global conflict resolution."
