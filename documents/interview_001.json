    "theory": "Disruptive Innovation Theory and Institutional Adoption Framework, specifically examining how blockchain technology serves as a bridge between traditional financial infrastructure and emerging decentralized systems",
    "philosophical_approach": "Pragmatic institutionalism - focusing on how blockchain technology can complement rather than replace existing financial infrastructure, evidenced by Ripple's approach to 'work with the legacy infrastructure' rather than attempting to completely rebuild the financial system",
    "rationale": "The framework is chosen based on Ripple's demonstrated strategy of: 1. Positioning blockchain as an efficiency-driving technology rather than a replacement for existing systems 2. Focusing on solving specific infrastructure problems (cross-border payments, custody) rather than pursuing broader technological disruption 3. Emphasizing institutional adoption and regulatory compliance as key drivers of blockchain technology integration into traditional finance"
