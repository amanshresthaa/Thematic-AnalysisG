Yes, there\u2019s more competition in the area.\n    Score: 0.6\n  - Chunk ID: Document_chunk_1\n    Content: When you say that, do you mean the farm side or the [org name]? I think the [org name]. [org name] is 3 farmers, we all grow potatoes. We are all selling individually, and what we\u2019re trying to do is come together to make an organisation basically, where all our potatoes are bought centrally and marketed all together. This organization is designed to streamline the process, allowing us to work collectively rather than as isolated entities. So, fundamentally, we brought in a trader to take the burden out of the individual farms and get closer to the customers, because the customers don\u2019t really want to deal with the farms; they would rather go through an organization. This setup acts as an interface between the farmers and the customers, ensuring that the organization is owned by the farmers and tailored to their needs.\n    Score: 0.36666666666666664\n  - Chunk ID: Document_chunk_17\n    Content: Initially, we had to go through other channels outside of [org name], which meant a significant portion of the profits was absorbed by the middleman. Our primary goal is to eliminate this intermediary, ensuring that all the money that would typically go to them is redirected back to the farmers. We are not focused on generating profit for ourselves; instead, our mission is to ensure that the financial benefits are passed directly to the farmers. This is a fundamental issue in the agricultural industry\u2014money is not reaching the farmers as it should. The lack of financial return to farmers is a critical problem we aim to address through our organization.\n    Score: 0.2\n  - Chunk ID: Document_chunk_18\n    Content: This segment illustrates the impact of [org name]'s strategy on the local agricultural market. By cutting out the middleman and centralizing the purchasing and marketing of potatoes, they have created a more competitive environment. The speaker acknowledges that their efforts have prompted other organizations to merge and adapt, indicating a shift in the market dynamics. This competition is seen as a positive development, suggesting that the organization's model is gaining traction and encouraging others to rethink their approaches to potato distribution and sales.\n    Score: 0.1\n  - Chunk ID: Document_chunk_52\n    Content: The speaker acknowledges that while [org name] could potentially contribute to developing processing capacity, financial limitations pose a significant barrier. They emphasize that substantial investment is required for such initiatives, but current profit margins in agriculture are insufficient to support this. The banking industry's withdrawal from agricultural financing further complicates the situation, making it difficult for organizations like [org name] to secure the necessary funds to invest in processing capabilities. This highlights the critical need for financial support and investment in the agricultural sector to foster growth and sustainability.\n    Score: 0.05\n\nTask: Select quotations that align with the research objectives and theoretical framework while following these criteria:\n\nFor each quotation, provide:\n\n1. quotation_data:\n{\n    \"quotation\": str,                    # The exact quotation text\n    \"context\": str,                  # Surrounding context from interview\n    \"type\": str,                     # 'discrete' (brief diverse perspectives)\n                                    # 'embedded' (transition phrases) \n                                    # 'longer' (complex understanding)\n    \"function\": str,                 # 'evidence' | 'explanation' | 'illustration' | \n                                    # 'impression' | 'representation'\n    \"pattern_strength\": float,       # 0.0-1.0 indicating robustness of pattern\n    \"theoretical_alignment\": float   # 0.0-1.0 alignment with framework\n}\n\n2. analysis:\n{\n    \"selection_rationale\": str,     # Why this quotation was chosen \n    \"theoretical_relevance\": str,   # How quotation supports theoretical framework\n    \"objective_support\": str,       # How quotation advances research objectives\n    \"patterns\": str                 # Key patterns identified\n}\n\nKey Guidelines:\n1.
