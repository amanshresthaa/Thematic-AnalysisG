We could, but the trouble with all these ideas is that they cost a lot of money. And at a farm level, there isn\u2019t a lot of money left in the tank to be able to chuck at these things. You\u2019ve got to make your profits to then reinvest them. And the banking industry is backing away from agriculture, because it\u2019s not seen as a very well \u2013 the profit margins are pathetic. So, it\u2019s building that to go forward. Money is key.",
                    "contextualized_content": "The speaker acknowledges that while [org name] could potentially contribute to developing processing capacity, financial limitations pose a significant barrier. They emphasize that substantial investment is required for such initiatives, but current profit margins in agriculture are insufficient to support this. The banking industry's withdrawal from agricultural financing further complicates the situation, making it difficult for organizations like [org name] to secure the necessary funds to invest in processing capabilities. This highlights the critical need for financial support and investment in the agricultural sector to foster growth and sustainability."

This uncertainty is not just a personal concern but reflects a collective anxiety within the farming community about the future of agriculture in the UK. The speaker emphasizes the importance of addressing these challenges through investment and support for local farming initiatives to ensure a stable and sustainable future."
