This statement underscores the pressing issue of inadequate processing capacity in the UK agricultural sector, which has been exacerbated by recent challenges such as Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. The speaker is concerned that without sufficient processing facilities, the hard work of farmers will not translate into marketable products, leading to waste and financial instability. This reflects a broader call for investment in local processing capabilities to ensure that farmers can effectively bring their produce to market and sustain their livelihoods."

As restaurants and similar businesses closed, the demand for potatoes plummeted, leading to a situation where farmers found themselves with excess stock and no buyers. As we plan for the 2021/2022 harvest, we face a dilemma: many customers are unwilling to sign contracts until they have a clearer understanding of future market conditions. This uncertainty places farmers in a difficult position; we must continue to invest in our operations by purchasing seeds and planting potatoes, even as customers express hesitance about future orders. The situation underscores the challenges of maintaining a stable supply chain in the face of unpredictable market dynamics."

The speaker expresses concern about the potential for thousands of tonnes of unsold potatoes due to the sudden halt in demand from restaurants and similar businesses. By suggesting that the Direct to Customer service could help, the speaker is considering innovative ways to reach consumers directly, thereby potentially reducing the surplus and ensuring that the produce is utilized effectively. This reflects a broader strategy to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer behaviors in the wake of the pandemic."
