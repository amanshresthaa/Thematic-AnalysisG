                    "original_content": "---\nThe factories, the customers \u2013 to be honest, the customers are quite happy paying a fair price for a good quality product.\n---\nThe problem is market prices \u2013 these dealers in the middle, and the factories, are really, when they can do, dropping the price for the farmers.\n---\nSo, we need to move closer to the end product where we can sustain a steady, average price for sustainability.\n---\nBecause in the last two years, we\u2019ve seen the base price collapse to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne.\n---\nAnd to give you an idea, we need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs, to break even.\n---\nAnd so, you can charge a fair price to the end customer whilst still getting enough profit to stay in business?\n---\nYes.\n---\nRight, good.\n---\nSo, we need to get close to then cut those rogues out the industry, really.\n---\nOkay, so it\u2019s cutting the rogues out.\n---\nSo, it sounds like you\u2019ve already taken the next step towards doing that by starting a direct-to-customer service?\n---\nYeah, that was done \u2013 we launched about four months\u2019 ago.\n---\nAnd this is basically the direction you\u2019re going in, to expand that part of the business?\n---\nIt\u2019s part of it yes.\n---\nObviously, there are different areas.\n---\nWe want more growers on board, more customers, and to grow that base we\u2019d need to add more of what we\u2019re doing and probably streamline what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s a three-way approach where we can drive out the inefficiencies, really.\n---\nAnd another thing, well as you know, things have changed quite recently \u2013 can you see any trends in society that could perhaps accelerate the vision that you\u2019ve just put forward, that might contribute to help?\n---\nObviously, COVID is a massive thing.\n---\nI do think there is more of an element of people wanting to know where it\u2019s come from.\n---\nAnd I think there is an element of people wanting that, but it\u2019s how you get the price and the customers to stop undermining everything we\u2019re doing in the UK, in the food industry.\n---\nBecause customers are willing to pay for it.\n---\nThey\u2019re willing to pay for quality.\n---\nBut, there\u2019s people within the system that will say, \u2018This is this,\u2019 but meanwhile bring some cheap stuff in the backdoor.\n---\nAnd that, as an industry, as a country, for food manufacturing areas we need to clamp down on.\n---\nI\u2019m wondering if Brexit is a factor?\n---\nIf it\u2019s harder to import things, would that be in your favour?\n---\nWell, it\u2019s harder to import things, definitely.\n---\nBut as a country we haven\u2019t got enough manufacturers to process the potatoes we have in the country anyway.\n---\nSo, we\u2019ve let it all go abroad, potatoes go to Belgium and then come back ready-made.\n---\nBut that might be more difficult.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s about developing manufacturing capacity to actually use what we already have?\n---\nWe use what here, we import a large amount of potatoes anyway, for ready-made meals and things like that.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the product to use, it\u2019s here in the country but we\u2019re not utilising it.\n---\nAnd the factories, the money has been invested in other countries, not the UK for processing potatoes.\n---\nAnd I know there\u2019s McCain\u2019s have reduced what they spend here, and [unclear \u2013 0:16:17:0] their major competitor take potatoes out of the UK, into Belgium, process them and they come back as a value pack for the supermarkets.\n---\nWhy are we allowing the road miles and everything else \u2013 it\u2019s crackers.\n---\nSo, it sounds like the bottle-neck is actually going to be processing capacity in the UK?\n---\nYes.\n---\nThe farmers are there, they\u2019ll do a good job.\n---\nThey\u2019re there to do it.\n---\nBut if they can\u2019t process what we produce, we\u2019re snookered.\n---\nWe\u2019re just flooding the market.\n---\nDo you think that [org name]  could actually, in any way, contribute towards helping with developing this processing capacity?\n---\nWe could, but the trouble with all these ideas is that they cost a lot of money.\n---\nAnd at a farm level, there isn\u2019t a lot of money left in the tank to be able to chuck at these things.\n---\nYou\u2019ve got to make your profits to then reinvest them.\n---\nAnd the banking industry is backing away from agriculture, because it\u2019s not seen as a very well \u2013 the profit margins are pathetic.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s building that to go forward.\n---\nMoney is key.\n---\nJust like a chicken and egg scenario, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nYes.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re aware of this issue but you might not be in a position personally to do much about it?\nExactly.\n---\nI can see the issue.\n---\nI know exactly what the issue is\n---\nand I know where you\u2019d take it forward.\n---\nBut without the investment or money to back what requires doing, it\u2019s a waste of time, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nSo, moving on a little bit more to financial issues, how resilient do you feel your organisation is?\n---\nHow stable do you think things might be, going forward in the next few years?\n---\nThe stability in [org name]  is fine.\n---\nThe stability in agriculture and farming is disastrous.\n---\nWithout the farmers and the potatoes, and supply what ever you\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not very stable.\n---\nThe problem is, manufacturing full stop.\n---\nIn this country I\u2019m hoping Brexit will change it but we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve got a good deal or a bad deal yet, do we?\n---\nIt\u2019s still evolving, yeah.\n---\nIt\u2019s a long way to go to get through this.\n---\nFarming is in a dire mess.\n---\nAnd that includes potatoes.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s not necessarily for the price, it\u2019s the weather patterns and everything.\n---\nIt\u2019s very, very difficult.\n---\nI\u2019m looking at things from two sides of the fence.\n---\nAnd so, which two sides?\n---\nThe side of the farmer, I\u2019ve a \u00a32 million turnover business farming.\n---\nAnd it\u2019s not paying.\n---\nAnd I\u2019m on the [org name] , the middle part of that is paying, but without farmers, you haven\u2019t got a business.\n---\nSo, this is basically the main risk, the whole farming industry in the UK after Brexit?\n---\nWe don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s going to go.\n---\nThere are very few farms in the last two or even three years that are actually profitable to a level that is satisfactory to a bank manager.\n---\nThat is worrying indeed.\n---\nAnd the banks are \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult for them to lend, if the business has a negative cash flow, through no fault of their own.\n---\nAnd there\u2019ll be a lot of businesses after COVID with the same scenario now.\n---\nWe\u2019ll come back to COVID in a moment, but in your answer to business and in [org name] , what sort of contingency plans to you have for the next few years, to deal with these risks?\n---\nThe contingency plan for the farm side of things is basically reduce what I\u2019m doing, because I cannot risk the losses.\n---\nSo, I\u2019m actually downscaling what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nReducing the farm size.\n---\nNow I\u2019m in my late 30\u2019s (nearly 40!), I should really be pushing things on.\n---\nYeah, building things up, developing them, yeah.\n---\nDeveloping, and actually, we doing quite the opposite.\n---\nI\u2019m doing the less.\n---\nFrom the [org name]  point of view, basically, I\u2019m getting more growers on board and spreading the risk out to more growers.\n---\nSo, the more growers we get, the less at risk we are.\n---\nSo, can reduce risk on the [org name]  side by diversifying, bringing in more growers, and on the farm side all you can do is down scale to a point at which you feel you can operate?\nWhich is downscale to a point at which it\u2019s manageable and we can guarantee sales through all of our products we produce.\n---\nWhat else can you do?\n---\nI\u2019m going to be here in the future.\n---\nYes, you\u2019re just not quite sure how.\n---\nThat\u2019s all rather worrying.",

This initiative is part of a broader strategy to expand their business, attract more growers and customers, and streamline operations to drive out inefficiencies. The speaker notes that societal trends, particularly post-COVID, indicate a growing consumer interest in knowing the origins of their food, which could further support their vision. However, they also acknowledge the challenges posed by Brexit, particularly regarding the lack of processing capacity in the UK, which has led to a reliance on importing processed products. \n\nThe organization is aware of the financial constraints within the agricultural sector, as the banking industry has been hesitant to invest due to low profit margins. They emphasize the need for investment to develop processing capacity and ensure that farmers can effectively utilize their produce. The speaker expresses concern about the overall stability of agriculture in the UK, especially in light of recent challenges, and highlights the importance of diversifying their grower base to mitigate risks."

organisation?\n---\n[org name] , as an organisation, we had contracts \u2013 our customers basically tore up in front of us.\n---\nFor supply, we\u2019ve basically not been able to move the tonnage required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped.\n---\nAnd I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector.\n---\nSo, all of a sudden, we had a lot of potatoes sat there with no homes.\n---\nThat was a major effect.\n---\nTo the point after the lockdown now, this sector doesn\u2019t require the potatoes.\n---\nAnd we\u2019re planning now for 2021/2022 harvest and to be quite honest we\u2019ve got customers who won\u2019t sign a contract with us until they know more about what is going to happen.\n---\nBut as a farmer, you have to buy the seed, you have to plant the potatoes, you can\u2019t stop.\n---\nBut the customers are just saying, \u2018Well, not sure.\n---\nPlant them \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know later in the year whether we\u2019re going to take them or not.\u2019\n---\nAre you fearing you might end up with a pile of potatoes you can\u2019t sell to anybody?\nAbsolutely.\n---\nThousands of tonnes of potatoes in the ground and in sheds which will not get processed or used.\n---\nThey\u2019ll just get wasted.\n---\nI wonder if the Direct to Customer service could help here?\n---\nIf you could get some straight to the customers, would that help?\n---\nThere is an element of that, but there are a lot of people who don\u2019t use potatoes \u2013 the cooking at home is rice, it\u2019s pasta.\n---\nCertainly, don\u2019t want to be importing stuff, which is what\u2019s coming up.\n---\nSo, if you want to help the British farmers, the supermarkets, the factories need to stop importing stuff.\n---\nAnd start taking things from British suppliers.\n---\nSo, is [org name]  a suitable venue to publicise this, to actually say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got all this stuff, you don\u2019t need to go abroad\u2019?\n---\nWell, it is, but we\u2019re probably not a big enough player.\n---\nWhen you\u2019re talking to the likes of McCain\u2019s, and Walkers, and those sorts of people, they\u2019re a multinational company anyway, they have suppliers from all over the place.\n---\nIt\u2019s got to come from government level really, to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019\n---\nOr the supermarkets, the customers.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not the public, it is the supermarkets.\n---\nAnd the government has got to say, \u2018No, enough is enough.\u2019\n---\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID?\n---\nAnything at all?\n---\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes \u2013 that side of things has done very well on the back of it.\n---\nSo, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s good.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not to the same scale as what we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\n---\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re not going to go quite back to the way you were before?\n---\nIt\u2019s going to be different?\n---\nIt\u2019ll certainly be different.\n---\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\n---\nYeah, it\u2019s killing agriculture big style.\n---\nIf all the manufacturers stop, it\u2019ll kill it.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s all very worrying.\n---\nWell, I hope things get better for you.\n---\nI\u2019ve come to the end of my questions now, you\u2019ve shed a lot of insight into what\u2019s sort of happening in this situation.\n---\nI wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\n---\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\n---\nWe\u2019ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that.\n---\nFind out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI think there are two-three solutions to the problem.\n---\nOne, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to.\n---\nI think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back.\n---\nAnd these food miles are absolutely nuts.\n---\nIt\u2019s mad.\n---\nAnd yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nWe\u2019ll have no business left.\n---\nThe banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\n---\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really!\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down.\n---\nBut I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves.\n---\nWe need to be able survive\n---\nand we need to be competitive.\n---\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\n---\nYes.\n---\nAnd the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot.\n---\nPut it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\n---\nThat seems very clear.\n---\nAs we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\n---\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\n---\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s more money coming back to the farm.\n---\nEND",
                    "contextualized_content": "The COVID crisis has had a profound impact on [org name] and the agricultural sector as a whole. With contracts being abruptly canceled, the organization faced a significant challenge in moving the required tonnage of potatoes, particularly as one-third of the potato industry supplies the food sector, which includes restaurants that suddenly ceased operations. This left a surplus of potatoes with no market, leading to concerns about waste and financial losses. As they plan for the upcoming harvest, uncertainty looms as customers hesitate to commit to contracts, creating a precarious situation for farmers who must continue planting without guaranteed sales. \n\nDespite these challenges, there have been some positive developments, such as the growth of small outlets and online sales, which have gained traction during the pandemic. However, the overall landscape remains daunting, with the combination of COVID and Brexit posing significant threats to the agricultural industry. The speaker emphasizes the need for local sourcing and investment to create a more resilient food system, advocating for a reduction in food miles and a more efficient distribution of resources to support farmers and ensure sustainability."

                    "original_content": "Could you say a little bit about your organisation\u2019s activities?\n---\nWhen you say that, do you mean the farm side or the [org name] ?\n---\nI think the [org name].\n---\n[org name] is 3 farmers, we all grow potatoes.\n---\nWe are all selling individually, and what we\u2019re trying to do is come together to make an organisation basically, where all our potatoes are bought centrally and marketed all together.\n---\nSo, fundamentally, we brought in a trader to take the burden out of the individual farms and get closer to the customers, because the customers don\u2019t really want to deal with the farms, they would rather go through an organisation.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s like an interface between the farmers and the customers?\n---\nYes, basically, somewhere in the middle it\u2019s owned by the farmers.\n---\nSet up for the farmers.\n---\nAnd the idea is by taking the middle man out, we are the middle man.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re taking the middle man out from between the farmers and the market?\n---\nYes.\n---\nWe are the traders in the middle.\n---\nThat\u2019s great.\n---\nWhat\u2019s your personal involvement in this?\n---\nWhat role do you play?\n---\nWhen the factory wants loads, well, rather than going to individual farms, we manage their supply into the factory.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s about ten-fifteen farms, supplying in.\n---\nAnd we manage that supply so that there\u2019s a steady supply of potatoes rather than odds and sods here and there.\n---\nThen obviously, they pay [org name]  and [org name]  distributes the money out to the farmers.\n---\nSo, I believe you operate on a local level?\n---\nThe main core of the group is local.\n---\nBut then we do supply factories all over the country.\n---\nAnd we buy potatoes from all over the country as well, on an ad hoc basis, so we can supply all year round because potatoes arrive at different periods of the year.\n---\nAnd obviously, we want to supply the factories all year round, and they want a supply all year round.\n---\nSo, we buy from other farms as well, which supply at different times of year, it varies.\n---\nIs this nationally, or do you do anything with factories or suppliers in other countries?\n---\nWe do a little bit.\n---\nWe have exported in the past.\n---\nNot much this year.\n---\nLast year we were exporting and importing.\n---\nBut it\u2019s only really to fill any gaps.\n---\nWhen we have extreme heat, or anything like that, we just fill in gaps when there\u2019s surplus, things like that.\n---\nSo, you operate locally, regionally and nationally.\n---\nBut internationally when you have to, when there\u2019s a gap?\n---\nYeah, when there are too many potatoes here, we have exported to Poland, exported to Ireland and Belgium quite a bit.\n---\nBut that\u2019s not a regular thing, that\u2019s just when the market requires it, if there\u2019s an opportunity we have to grab it.\n---\nHow would you consider yourself to be innovative?\n---\nWhat do you feel you are doing differently?\n---\nInitially we had to go through somewhere else other than [org name] and there is a lot of money in the middle man.\n---\nAnd basically, the idea was that we cut out the middle man and all that money comes back to the farm.\n---\nSo, we\u2019re not there to make money, we\u2019re there to pass the money back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that is the crux of the industry that has not been happening.\n---\nThe money going back to farmers \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s not been happening?\n---\nIt\u2019s not been going back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s what you aim to address?\n---\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to deal with.\n---\nAnd since we\u2019ve become in the area, doing what we\u2019re doing, these other mergers in the middle are taking the mass market out because they have to compete.\n---\nSo, are you saying there\u2019s now competition?\n---\nThere\u2019s more competition in the area.\n---\nSo, people have seen that it\u2019s a good idea and they want in on it?\n---\nYes, as it were.\n---\nI\u2019ve just obeyed the company really.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got a lot to do, to get to where we want to get to.\n---\nIt\u2019s certainly helping.\n---\nObviously, after Covid it\u2019s been a challenging year.\nIndeed.\n---\nSo, in terms of collaborators \u2013 well you\u2019ve touched on competition, but considering who you\u2019re collaborating with at the moment, there\u2019s the three farms and other suppliers?\n---\nThere\u2019s three farms that are direct suppliers, and then we have contractual other farms, basically guaranteeing us their spuds, contracted into the group.\n---\nAnd we supply factories like Walkers, McCains, Seabrooks \u2013 various crisps, all those sorts of people.\n---\n[unclear] Food, we do a little bit of pre-packaged for supermarkets with Morrison\u2019s and different people.\n---\n[unclear 0:08:51.0]\nAnd you\u2019ve explained that your role in this network is bypassing the middle man and making sure that the most profit goes from the customers back to the farmers?\n---\nYes, basically.\n---\nWho amongst the people you\u2019re working with, who are crucial?\n---\nWith the other people who you\u2019ve mentioned, who you\u2019re collaborating with, are they all crucial to the functioning of [org name] ?\n---\nNo, not the day-to-day running of it.\n---\nI\u2019m obviously managing the office with staff.\n---\nThey are obviously directors of the business, interested in how it works, but the day-to-day management comes back to me and the staff.\n---\nIs that what you mean?\n---\nYes, so what you\u2019re saying is that if a supplier dropped out, you could find a different supplier, and things like that?\n---\nYes, obviously the crucial thing is suppliers and farmers.\n---\nIf you haven\u2019t got them, or enough of them to supply the demand you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nSo, they\u2019re the important ones?\n---\nYes.\n---\nPlus, of course, the people who like yourself, are actually running the organisation, running the outfit?\n---\nWho\u2019s crucial within who runs it?\n---\nI think you just mentioned the people who are managing it?\n---\nYeah, that\u2019s me, we\u2019re the crucial ones.\n---\nWell, if we don\u2019t do what we do then someone else will do it.\n---\nBut yeah, we are the ones making it work.\n---\nSo, I think, looking a little bit towards the future, if you consider the next few years, and for the longer term, perhaps the next fifteen years, what would you say is your vision for what you might call, \u2018Future Food Systems\u2019?\n---\nMy vision for the future \u2013 I think sustainability is the key to anything.\n---\nIf we don\u2019t have sustainability, we\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nI want to bring more farmers on board, to grow our members; to see the benefits of what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nAnd also, to look at taking this \u2013 we\u2019ve just started off a 7.5kg bag line, it\u2019s a new thing for us, getting closer to the customer, and I think we\u2019ll look at something else to get closer to the customer really and cut the factories out, where we become further down the chain.\n---\nThe closer to the customer we get, the more we\u2019ll get back to the farm.\n---\nSo, ultimately you would have a process that would take the produce directly from the farm, straight to the end customer?\n---\nThat is the ultimate.\n---\nI think rather than just selling the potato, we\u2019ll slice it, and things like that.\n---\nOr we\u2019ll put it into ready-made meals.\n---\nWell maybe not that, but get it ready to go closer to the end user.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re sort of gradually, as you mentioned, bypassing elements of the chain, starting recently with going direct to consumer and that\u2019s the direction you want to take in the future?\n---\nI think one thing is the scale, we need to increase the volumes we trade as a group.\n---\nAnd on the other side we need an avenue where we get closer to the customer, to take the volatility out of the job.\n---\nAnd how do you feel this will contribute to sustainability?\nBecause you\u2019ve got [unclear] contracts in front of you.",

                    "original_content": "Could you say a little bit about your organisation\u2019s activities?\n---\nWhen you say that, do you mean the farm side or the [org name] ?\n---\nI think the [org name].\n---\n[org name] is 3 farmers, we all grow potatoes.\n---\nWe are all selling individually, and what we\u2019re trying to do is come together to make an organisation basically, where all our potatoes are bought centrally and marketed all together.\n---\nSo, fundamentally, we brought in a trader to take the burden out of the individual farms and get closer to the customers, because the customers don\u2019t really want to deal with the farms, they would rather go through an organisation.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s like an interface between the farmers and the customers?\n---\nYes, basically, somewhere in the middle it\u2019s owned by the farmers.\n---\nSet up for the farmers.\n---\nAnd the idea is by taking the middle man out, we are the middle man.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re taking the middle man out from between the farmers and the market?\n---\nYes.\n---\nWe are the traders in the middle.\n---\nThat\u2019s great.\n---\nWhat\u2019s your personal involvement in this?\n---\nWhat role do you play?\n---\nWhen the factory wants loads, well, rather than going to individual farms, we manage their supply into the factory.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s about ten-fifteen farms, supplying in.\n---\nAnd we manage that supply so that there\u2019s a steady supply of potatoes rather than odds and sods here and there.\n---\nThen obviously, they pay [org name]  and [org name]  distributes the money out to the farmers.\n---\nSo, I believe you operate on a local level?\n---\nThe main core of the group is local.\n---\nBut then we do supply factories all over the country.\n---\nAnd we buy potatoes from all over the country as well, on an ad hoc basis, so we can supply all year round because potatoes arrive at different periods of the year.\n---\nAnd obviously, we want to supply the factories all year round, and they want a supply all year round.\n---\nSo, we buy from other farms as well, which supply at different times of year, it varies.\n---\nIs this nationally, or do you do anything with factories or suppliers in other countries?\n---\nWe do a little bit.\n---\nWe have exported in the past.\n---\nNot much this year.\n---\nLast year we were exporting and importing.\n---\nBut it\u2019s only really to fill any gaps.\n---\nWhen we have extreme heat, or anything like that, we just fill in gaps when there\u2019s surplus, things like that.\n---\nSo, you operate locally, regionally and nationally.\n---\nBut internationally when you have to, when there\u2019s a gap?\n---\nYeah, when there are too many potatoes here, we have exported to Poland, exported to Ireland and Belgium quite a bit.\n---\nBut that\u2019s not a regular thing, that\u2019s just when the market requires it, if there\u2019s an opportunity we have to grab it.\n---\nHow would you consider yourself to be innovative?\n---\nWhat do you feel you are doing differently?\n---\nInitially we had to go through somewhere else other than [org name] and there is a lot of money in the middle man.\n---\nAnd basically, the idea was that we cut out the middle man and all that money comes back to the farm.\n---\nSo, we\u2019re not there to make money, we\u2019re there to pass the money back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that is the crux of the industry that has not been happening.\n---\nThe money going back to farmers \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s not been happening?\n---\nIt\u2019s not been going back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s what you aim to address?\n---\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to deal with.\n---\nAnd since we\u2019ve become in the area, doing what we\u2019re doing, these other mergers in the middle are taking the mass market out because they have to compete.\n---\nSo, are you saying there\u2019s now competition?\n---\nThere\u2019s more competition in the area.\n---\nSo, people have seen that it\u2019s a good idea and they want in on it?\n---\nYes, as it were.\n---\nI\u2019ve just obeyed the company really.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got a lot to do, to get to where we want to get to.\n---\nIt\u2019s certainly helping.\n---\nObviously, after Covid it\u2019s been a challenging year.\nIndeed.\n---\nSo, in terms of collaborators \u2013 well you\u2019ve touched on competition, but considering who you\u2019re collaborating with at the moment, there\u2019s the three farms and other suppliers?\n---\nThere\u2019s three farms that are direct suppliers, and then we have contractual other farms, basically guaranteeing us their spuds, contracted into the group.\n---\nAnd we supply factories like Walkers, McCains, Seabrooks \u2013 various crisps, all those sorts of people.\n---\n[unclear] Food, we do a little bit of pre-packaged for supermarkets with Morrison\u2019s and different people.\n---\n[unclear 0:08:51.0]\nAnd you\u2019ve explained that your role in this network is bypassing the middle man and making sure that the most profit goes from the customers back to the farmers?\n---\nYes, basically.\n---\nWho amongst the people you\u2019re working with, who are crucial?\n---\nWith the other people who you\u2019ve mentioned, who you\u2019re collaborating with, are they all crucial to the functioning of [org name] ?\n---\nNo, not the day-to-day running of it.\n---\nI\u2019m obviously managing the office with staff.\n---\nThey are obviously directors of the business, interested in how it works, but the day-to-day management comes back to me and the staff.\n---\nIs that what you mean?\n---\nYes, so what you\u2019re saying is that if a supplier dropped out, you could find a different supplier, and things like that?\n---\nYes, obviously the crucial thing is suppliers and farmers.\n---\nIf you haven\u2019t got them, or enough of them to supply the demand you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ve got

next fifteen years, what would you say is your vision for what you might call, \u2018Future Food Systems\u2019?\n---\nMy vision for the future \u2013 I think sustainability is the key to

organisation?\n---\n[org name] , as an organisation, we had contracts \u2013 our customers basically tore up in front of us.\n---\nFor supply, we\u2019ve basically not been able to move the tonnage required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped.\n---\nAnd I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector.\n---\nSo, all of a sudden, we had a lot of potatoes sat there with no homes.\n---\nThat was a major effect.\n---\nTo the point after the lockdown now, this sector doesn\u2019t require the potatoes.\n---\nAnd we\u2019re planning now for 2021/2022 harvest and to be quite honest we\u2019ve got customers who won\u2019t sign a contract with us until they know more about what is going to happen.\n---\nBut as a farmer, you have to buy the seed, you have to plant the potatoes, you can\u2019t stop.\n---\nBut the customers are just saying, \u2018Well, not sure.\n---\nPlant them \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know later in the year whether we\u2019re going to take them or not.\u2019\n---\nAre you fearing you might end up with a pile of potatoes you can\u2019t sell to anybody?\nAbsolutely.\n---\nThousands of tonnes of potatoes in the ground and in sheds which will not get processed or used.\n---\nThey\u2019ll just get wasted.\n---\nI wonder if the Direct to Customer service could help here?\n---\nIf you could get some straight to the customers, would that help?\n---\nThere is an element of that, but there are a lot of people who don\u2019t use potatoes \u2013 the cooking at home is rice, it\u2019s pasta.\n---\nCertainly, don\u2019t want to be importing stuff, which is what\u2019s coming up.\n---\nSo, if you want to help the British farmers, the supermarkets, the factories need to stop importing stuff.\n---\nAnd start taking things from British suppliers.\n---\nSo, is [org name]  a suitable venue to publicise this, to actually say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got all this stuff, you don\u2019t need to go abroad\u2019?\n---\nWell, it is, but we\u2019re probably not a big enough player.\n---\nWhen you\u2019re talking to the likes of McCain\u2019s, and Walkers, and those sorts of people, they\u2019re a multinational company anyway, they have suppliers from all over the place.\n---\nIt\u2019s got to come from government level really, to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019\n---\nOr the supermarkets, the customers.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not the public, it is the supermarkets.\n---\nAnd the government has got to say, \u2018No, enough is enough.\u2019\n---\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID?\n---\nAnything at all?\n---\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes \u2013 that side of things has done very well on the back of it.\n---\nSo, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s good.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not to the same scale as what we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\n---\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re not going to go quite back to the way you were before?\n---\nIt\u2019s going to be different?\n---\nIt\u2019ll certainly be different.\n---\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\n---\nYeah, it\u2019s killing agriculture big style.\n---\nIf all the manufacturers stop, it\u2019ll kill it.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s all very worrying.\n---\nWell, I hope things get better for you.\n---\nI\u2019ve come to the end of my questions now, you\u2019ve shed a lot of insight into what\u2019s sort of happening in this situation.\n---\nI wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\n---\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\n---\nWe\u2019ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that.\n---\nFind out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI think there are two-three solutions to the problem.\n---\nOne, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to.\n---\nI think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back.\n---\nAnd these food miles are absolutely nuts.\n---\nIt\u2019s mad.\n---\nAnd yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nWe\u2019ll have no business left.\n---\nThe banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\n---\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really!\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down.\n---\nBut I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves.\n---\nWe need to be able survive\n---\nand we need to be competitive.\n---\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\n---\nYes.\n---\nAnd the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot.\n---\nPut it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\n---\nThat seems very clear.\n---\nAs we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\n---\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\n---\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s more money coming back to the farm.\n---\nEND",
                    "contextualized_content": "The COVID crisis has had a profound impact on [org name] and the agricultural sector as a whole. With contracts being abruptly canceled, the organization faced a significant challenge in moving the required tonnage of potatoes, particularly as one-third of the potato industry supplies the food sector, which includes restaurants that suddenly ceased operations. This left a surplus of potatoes with no market, leading to concerns about waste and financial losses. As they plan for the upcoming harvest, uncertainty looms as customers hesitate to commit to contracts, creating a precarious situation for farmers who must continue planting without guaranteed sales. \n\nDespite these challenges, there have been some positive developments, such as the growth of small outlets and online sales, which have gained traction during the pandemic. However, the overall landscape remains daunting, with the combination of COVID and Brexit posing significant threats to the agricultural industry. The speaker emphasizes the need for local sourcing and investment to create a more resilient food system, advocating for a reduction in food miles and a more efficient distribution of resources to support farmers and ensure sustainability."

factor?\n---\nIf it\u2019s harder to import things, would that be in your favour?\n---\nWell, it\u2019s harder to import things, definitely.\n---\nBut as a country we haven\u2019t got enough manufacturers to process the potatoes we have in the country anyway.\n---\nSo, we\u2019ve let it all go abroad, potatoes go to Belgium and then come back ready-made.\n---\nBut that might be more difficult.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s about developing manufacturing capacity to actually use what we already have?\n---\nWe use what here, we import a large amount of potatoes anyway, for ready-made meals and things like that.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the product to use, it\u2019s here in the country but we\u2019re not utilising it.\n---\nAnd the factories, the money has been invested in other countries, not the UK for processing potatoes.\n---\nAnd I know there\u2019s McCain\u2019s have reduced what they spend here, and [unclear \u2013 0:16:17:0] their major competitor take potatoes out of the UK, into Belgium, process them and they come back as a value pack for the supermarkets.\n---\nWhy are we allowing the road miles and everything else \u2013 it\u2019s crackers.\n---\nSo, it sounds like the bottle-neck is actually going to be processing capacity in the UK?\n---\nYes.\n---\nThe farmers are there, they\u2019ll do a good job.\n---\nThey\u2019re there to do it.\n---\nBut if they can\u2019t process what we produce, we\u2019re snookered.\n---\nWe\u2019re just flooding the market.\n---\nDo you think that [org name]  could actually, in any way, contribute towards helping with developing this processing capacity?\n---\nWe could, but the trouble with all these ideas is that they cost a lot of money.\n---\nAnd at a farm level, there isn\u2019t a lot of money left in the tank to be able to chuck at these things.\n---\nYou\u2019ve got to make your profits to then reinvest them.\n---\nAnd the banking industry is backing away from agriculture, because it\u2019s not seen as a very well \u2013 the profit margins are pathetic.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s building that to go forward.\n---\nMoney is key.\n---\nJust like a chicken and egg scenario, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nYes.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re aware of this issue but you might not be in a position personally to do much about it?\nExactly.\n---\nI can see the issue.\n---\nI know exactly what the issue is\n---\nand I know where you\u2019d take it forward.\n---\nBut without the investment or money to back what requires doing, it\u2019s a waste of time, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nSo, moving on a little bit more to financial issues, how resilient do you feel your organisation is?\n---\nHow stable do you think things might be, going forward in the next few years?\n---\nThe stability in [org name]  is fine.\n---\nThe stability in agriculture and farming is disastrous.\n---\nWithout the farmers and the potatoes, and supply what ever you\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not very stable.\n---\nThe problem is, manufacturing full stop.\n---\nIn this country I\u2019m hoping Brexit will change it but we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve got a good deal or a bad deal yet, do we?\n---\nIt\u2019s still evolving, yeah.\n---\nIt\u2019s a long way to go to get through this.\n---\nFarming is in a dire mess.\n---\nAnd that includes potatoes.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s not necessarily for the price, it\u2019s the weather patterns and everything.\n---\nIt\u2019s very, very difficult.\n---\nI\u2019m looking at things from two sides of the fence.\n---\nAnd so, which two sides?\n---\nThe side of the farmer, I\u2019ve a \u00a32 million turnover business farming.\n---\nAnd it\u2019s not paying.\n---\nAnd I\u2019m on the [org name] , the middle part of that is paying, but without farmers, you haven\u2019t got a business.\n---\nSo, this is basically the main risk, the whole farming industry in the UK after Brexit?\n---\nWe don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s going to go.\n---\nThere are very few farms in the last two or even three years that are actually profitable to a level that is satisfactory to a bank manager.\n---\nThat is worrying indeed.\n---\nAnd the banks are \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult for them to lend, if the business has a negative cash flow, through no fault of their own.\n---\nAnd there\u2019ll be a lot of businesses after COVID with the same scenario now.\n---\nWe\u2019ll come back to COVID in a moment, but in your answer to business and in [org name] , what sort of contingency plans to you have for the next few years, to deal with these risks?\n---\nThe contingency plan for the farm side of things is basically reduce what I\u2019m doing, because I cannot risk the losses.\n---\nSo, I\u2019m actually downscaling what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nReducing the farm size.\n---\nNow I\u2019m in my late 30\u2019s (nearly 40!), I should really be pushing things on.\n---\nYeah, building things up, developing them, yeah.\n---\nDeveloping, and actually, we doing quite the opposite.\n---\nI\u2019m doing the less.\n---\nFrom the [org name]  point of view, basically, I\u2019m getting more growers on board and spreading the risk out to more growers.\n---\nSo, the more growers we get, the less at risk we are.\n---\nSo, can reduce risk on the [org name]  side by diversifying, bringing in more growers, and on the farm side all you can do is down scale to a point at which you feel you can operate?\nWhich is downscale to a point at which it\u2019s manageable and we can guarantee sales through all of our products we produce.\n---\nWhat else can you do?\n---\nI\u2019m going to be here in the future.\n---\nYes, you\u2019re just not quite sure how.\n---\nThat\u2019s all rather worrying.",

However, the problem lies in market prices, where dealers in the middle and factories often drop the price for farmers when they can. This creates a need to move closer to the end product to sustain a steady, average price for sustainability. In the last two years, the base price has collapsed to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne, while farmers need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs and break even. The organization aims to charge a fair price to the end customer while ensuring enough profit to stay in business, which is crucial for their sustainability efforts. \n\nTo achieve this, they recognize the necessity of cutting out the \"rogues\" in the industry and have already taken steps towards this by launching a direct-to-customer service about four months ago. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to expand their business, attract more growers and customers, and streamline operations to drive out inefficiencies. The speaker notes that societal trends, particularly post-COVID, indicate a growing consumer interest in knowing the origins of their food, which could further support their vision. However, they also acknowledge the challenges posed by Brexit, particularly regarding the lack of processing capacity in the UK, which has led to a reliance on importing processed products. \n\nThe organization is aware of the financial constraints within the agricultural sector, as the banking industry has been hesitant to invest due to low profit margins. They emphasize the need for investment to develop processing capacity and ensure that farmers can effectively utilize their produce. The speaker expresses concern about the overall stability of agriculture in the UK, especially in light of recent challenges, and highlights the importance of diversifying their grower base to mitigate risks."

and things like that.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the product to use, it\u2019s here in the country but we\u2019re not utilising it.\n---\nAnd the factories, the money has been invested in other countries, not the UK for processing potatoes.\n---\nAnd I know there\u2019s McCain\u2019s have reduced what they spend here, and [unclear \u2013 0:16:17:0] their major competitor take potatoes out of the UK, into Belgium, process them and they come back as a value pack for the supermarkets.\n---\nWhy are we allowing the road miles and everything else \u2013 it\u2019s crackers.\n---\nSo, it sounds like the bottle-neck is actually going to be processing capacity in the UK?\n---\nYes.\n---\nThe farmers are there, they\u2019ll do a good job.\n---\nThey\u2019re there to do it.\n---\nBut if they can\u2019t process what we produce, we\u2019re snookered.\n---\nWe\u2019re just flooding the market.\n---\nDo you think that [org name]  could actually, in any way, contribute towards helping with developing this processing capacity?\n---\nWe could, but the trouble with all these ideas is that they cost a lot of money.\n---\nAnd at a farm level, there isn\u2019t a lot of money left in the tank to be able to chuck at these things.\n---\nYou\u2019ve got to make your profits to then reinvest them.\n---\nAnd the banking industry is backing away from agriculture, because it\u2019s not seen as a very well \u2013 the profit margins are pathetic.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s building that to go forward.\n---\nMoney is key.\n---\nJust like a chicken and egg scenario, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nYes.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re aware of this issue but you might not be in a position personally to do much about it?\nExactly.\n---\nI can see the issue.\n---\nI know exactly what the issue is\n---\nand I know where you\u2019d take it forward.\n---\nBut without the investment or money to back what requires doing, it\u2019s a waste of time, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nSo, moving on a little bit more to financial issues, how resilient do you feel your organisation is?\n---\nHow stable do you think things might be, going forward in the next few years?\n---\nThe stability in [org name]  is fine.\n---\nThe stability in agriculture and farming is disastrous.\n---\nWithout the farmers and the potatoes, and supply what ever you\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not very stable.\n---\nThe problem is, manufacturing full stop.\n---\nIn this country I\u2019m hoping Brexit will change it but we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve got a good deal or a bad deal yet, do we?\n---\nIt\u2019s still evolving, yeah.\n---\nIt\u2019s a long way to go to get through this.\n---\nFarming is in a dire mess.\n---\nAnd that includes potatoes.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s not necessarily for the price, it\u2019s the weather patterns and everything.\n---\nIt\u2019s very, very difficult.\n---\nI\u2019m looking at things from two sides of the fence.\n---\nAnd so, which two sides?\n---\nThe side of the farmer, I\u2019ve a \u00a32 million turnover business farming.\n---\nAnd it\u2019s not paying.\n---\nAnd I\u2019m on the [org name] , the middle part of that is paying, but without farmers, you haven\u2019t got a business.\n---\nSo, this is basically the main risk, the whole farming industry in the UK after Brexit?\n---\nWe don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s going to go.\n---\nThere are very few farms in the last two or even three years that are actually profitable to a level that is satisfactory to a bank manager.\n---\nThat is worrying indeed.\n---\nAnd the banks are \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult for them to lend, if the business has a negative cash flow, through no fault of their own.\n---\nAnd there\u2019ll be a lot of businesses after COVID with the same scenario now.\n---\nWe\u2019ll come back to COVID in a moment, but in your answer to business and in [org name] , what sort of contingency plans to you have for the next few years, to deal with these risks?\n---\nThe contingency plan for the farm side of things is basically reduce what I\u2019m doing, because I cannot risk the losses.\n---\nSo, I\u2019m actually downscaling what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nReducing the farm size.\n---\nNow I\u2019m in my late 30\u2019s (nearly 40!), I should really be pushing things on.\n---\nYeah, building things up, developing them, yeah.\n---\nDeveloping, and actually, we doing quite the opposite.\n---\nI\u2019m doing the less.\n---\nFrom the [org name]  point of view, basically, I\u2019m getting more growers on board and spreading the risk out to more growers.\n---\nSo, the more growers we get, the less at risk we are.\n---\nSo, can reduce risk on the [org name]  side by diversifying, bringing in more growers, and on the farm side all you can do is down scale to a point at which you feel you can operate?\nWhich is downscale to a point at which it\u2019s manageable and we can guarantee sales through all of our products we produce.\n---\nWhat else can you do?\n---\nI\u2019m going to be here in the future.\n---\nYes, you\u2019re just not quite sure how.\n---\nThat\u2019s all rather worrying.",

you\u2019ve already taken the next step towards doing that by starting a direct-to-customer service?\n---\nYeah, that was done \u2013 we launched about four months\u2019 ago.\n---\nAnd this is

organisation?\n---\n[org name] , as an organisation, we had contracts \u2013 our customers basically tore up in front of us.\n---\nFor supply, we\u2019ve basically not been able to move the tonnage required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped.\n---\nAnd I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector.\n---\nSo, all of a sudden, we had a lot of potatoes sat there with no homes.\n---\nThat was a major effect.\n---\nTo the point after the lockdown now, this sector doesn\u2019t require the potatoes.\n---\nAnd we\u2019re planning now for 2021/2022 harvest and to be quite honest we\u2019ve got customers who won\u2019t sign a contract with us until they know more about what is going to happen.\n---\nBut as a farmer, you have to buy the seed, you have to plant the potatoes, you can\u2019t stop.\n---\nBut the customers are just saying, \u2018Well, not sure.\n---\nPlant them \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know later in the year whether we\u2019re going to take them or not.\u2019\n---\nAre you fearing you might end up with a pile of potatoes you can\u2019t sell to anybody?\nAbsolutely.\n---\nThousands of tonnes of potatoes in the ground and in sheds which will not get processed or used.\n---\nThey\u2019ll just get wasted.\n---\nI wonder if the Direct to Customer service could help here?\n---\nIf you could get some straight to the customers, would that help?\n---\nThere is an element of that, but there are a lot of people who don\u2019t use potatoes \u2013 the cooking at home is rice, it\u2019s pasta.\n---\nCertainly, don\u2019t want to be importing stuff, which is what\u2019s coming up.\n---\nSo, if you want to help the British farmers, the supermarkets, the factories need to stop importing stuff.\n---\nAnd start taking things from British suppliers.\n---\nSo, is [org name]  a suitable venue to publicise this, to actually say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got all this stuff, you don\u2019t need to go abroad\u2019?\n---\nWell, it is, but we\u2019re probably not a big enough player.\n---\nWhen you\u2019re talking to the likes of McCain\u2019s, and Walkers, and those sorts of people, they\u2019re a multinational company anyway, they have suppliers from all over the place.\n---\nIt\u2019s got to come from government level really, to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019\n---\nOr the supermarkets, the customers.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not the public, it is the supermarkets.\n---\nAnd the government has got to say, \u2018No, enough is enough.\u2019\n---\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID?\n---\nAnything at all?\n---\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes \u2013 that side of things has done very well on the back of it.\n---\nSo, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s good.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not to the same scale as what we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\n---\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re not going to go quite back to the way you were before?\n---\nIt\u2019s going to be different?\n---\nIt\u2019ll certainly be different.\n---\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\n---\nYeah, it\u2019s killing agriculture big style.\n---\nIf all the manufacturers stop, it\u2019ll kill it.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s all very worrying.\n---\nWell, I hope things get better for you.\n---\nI\u2019ve come to the end of my questions now, you\u2019ve shed a lot of insight into what\u2019s sort of happening in this situation.\n---\nI wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\n---\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\n---\nWe\u2019ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that.\n---\nFind out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI think there are two-three solutions to the problem.\n---\nOne, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to.\n---\nI think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back.\n---\nAnd these food miles are absolutely nuts.\n---\nIt\u2019s mad.\n---\nAnd yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nWe\u2019ll have no business left.\n---\nThe banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\n---\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really!\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down.\n---\nBut I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves.\n---\nWe need to be able survive\n---\nand we need to be competitive.\n---\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\n---\nYes.\n---\nAnd the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot.\n---\nPut it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\n---\nThat seems very clear.\n---\nAs we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\n---\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\n---\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s more money coming back to the farm.\n---\nEND",
                    "contextualized_content": "The COVID crisis has had a profound impact on [org name] and the agricultural sector as a whole. With contracts being abruptly canceled, the organization faced a significant challenge in moving the required tonnage of potatoes, particularly as one-third of the potato industry supplies the food sector, which includes restaurants that suddenly ceased operations. This left a surplus of potatoes with no market, leading to concerns about waste and financial losses. As they plan for the upcoming harvest, uncertainty looms as customers hesitate to commit to contracts, creating a precarious situation for farmers who must continue planting without guaranteed sales. \n\nDespite these challenges, there have been some positive developments, such as the growth of small outlets and online sales, which have gained traction during the pandemic. However, the overall landscape remains daunting, with the combination of COVID and Brexit posing significant threats to the agricultural industry. The speaker emphasizes the need for local sourcing and investment to create a more resilient food system, advocating for a reduction in food miles and a more efficient distribution of resources to support farmers and ensure sustainability."

                    "original_content": "Could you say a little bit about your organisation\u2019s activities?\n---\nWhen you say that, do you mean the farm side or the [org name] ?\n---\nI think the [org name].\n---\n[org name] is 3 farmers, we all grow potatoes.\n---\nWe are all selling individually, and what we\u2019re trying to do is come together to make an organisation basically, where all our potatoes are bought centrally and marketed all together.\n---\nSo, fundamentally, we brought in a trader to take the burden out of the individual farms and get closer to the customers, because the customers don\u2019t really want to deal with the farms, they would rather go through an organisation.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s like an interface between the farmers and the customers?\n---\nYes, basically, somewhere in the middle it\u2019s owned by the farmers.\n---\nSet up for the farmers.\n---\nAnd the idea is by taking the middle man out, we are the middle man.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re taking the middle man out from between the farmers and the market?\n---\nYes.\n---\nWe are the traders in the middle.\n---\nThat\u2019s great.\n---\nWhat\u2019s your personal involvement in this?\n---\nWhat role do you play?\n---\nWhen the factory wants loads, well, rather than going to individual farms, we manage their supply into the factory.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s about ten-fifteen farms, supplying in.\n---\nAnd we manage that supply so that there\u2019s a steady supply of potatoes rather than odds and sods here and there.\n---\nThen obviously, they pay [org name]  and [org name]  distributes the money out to the farmers.\n---\nSo, I believe you operate on a local level?\n---\nThe main core of the group is local.\n---\nBut then we do supply factories all over the country.\n---\nAnd we buy potatoes from all over the country as well, on an ad hoc basis, so we can supply all year round because potatoes arrive at different periods of the year.\n---\nAnd obviously, we want to supply the factories all year round, and they want a supply all year round.\n---\nSo, we buy from other farms as well, which supply at different times of year, it varies.\n---\nIs this nationally, or do you do anything with factories or suppliers in other countries?\n---\nWe do a little bit.\n---\nWe have exported in the past.\n---\nNot much this year.\n---\nLast year we were exporting and importing.\n---\nBut it\u2019s only really to fill any gaps.\n---\nWhen we have extreme heat, or anything like that, we just fill in gaps when there\u2019s surplus, things like that.\n---\nSo, you operate locally, regionally and nationally.\n---\nBut internationally when you have to, when there\u2019s a gap?\n---\nYeah, when there are too many potatoes here, we have exported to Poland, exported to Ireland and Belgium quite a bit.\n---\nBut that\u2019s not a regular thing, that\u2019s just when the market requires it, if there\u2019s an opportunity we have to grab it.\n---\nHow would you consider yourself to be innovative?\n---\nWhat do you feel you are doing differently?\n---\nInitially we had to go through somewhere else other than [org name] and there is a lot of money in the middle man.\n---\nAnd basically, the idea was that we cut out the middle man and all that money comes back to the farm.\n---\nSo, we\u2019re not there to make money, we\u2019re there to pass the money back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that is the crux of the industry that has not been happening.\n---\nThe money going back to farmers \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s not been happening?\n---\nIt\u2019s not been going back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s what you aim to address?\n---\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to deal with.\n---\nAnd since we\u2019ve become in the area, doing what we\u2019re doing, these other mergers in the middle are taking the mass market out because they have to compete.\n---\nSo, are you saying there\u2019s now competition?\n---\nThere\u2019s more competition in the area.\n---\nSo, people have seen that it\u2019s a good idea and they want in on it?\n---\nYes, as it were.\n---\nI\u2019ve just obeyed the company really.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got a lot to do, to get to where we want to get to.\n---\nIt\u2019s certainly helping.\n---\nObviously, after Covid it\u2019s been a challenging year.\nIndeed.\n---\nSo, in terms of collaborators \u2013 well you\u2019ve touched on competition, but considering who you\u2019re collaborating with at the moment, there\u2019s the three farms and other suppliers?\n---\nThere\u2019s three farms that are direct suppliers, and then we have contractual other farms, basically guaranteeing us their spuds, contracted into the group.\n---\nAnd we supply factories like Walkers, McCains, Seabrooks \u2013 various crisps, all those sorts of people.\n---\n[unclear] Food, we do a little bit of pre-packaged for supermarkets with Morrison\u2019s and different people.\n---\n[unclear 0:08:51.0]\nAnd you\u2019ve explained that your role in this network is bypassing the middle man and making sure that the most profit goes from the customers back to the farmers?\n---\nYes, basically.\n---\nWho amongst the people you\u2019re working with, who are crucial?\n---\nWith the other people who you\u2019ve mentioned, who you\u2019re collaborating with, are they all crucial to the functioning of [org name] ?\n---\nNo, not the day-to-day running of it.\n---\nI\u2019m obviously managing the office with staff.\n---\nThey are obviously directors of the business, interested in how it works, but the day-to-day management comes back to me and the staff.\n---\nIs that what you mean?\n---\nYes, so what you\u2019re saying is that if a supplier dropped out, you could find a different supplier, and things like that?\n---\nYes, obviously the crucial thing is suppliers and farmers.\n---\nIf you haven\u2019t got them, or enough of them to supply the demand you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nSo, they\u2019re the important ones?\n---\nYes.\n---\nPlus, of course, the people who like yourself, are actually running the organisation, running the outfit?\n---\nWho\u2019s crucial within who runs it?\n---\nI think you just mentioned the people who are managing it?\n---\nYeah, that\u2019s me, we\u2019re the crucial ones.\n---\nWell, if we don\u2019t do what we do then someone else will do it.\n---\nBut yeah, we are the ones making it work.\n---\nSo, I think, looking a little bit towards the future, if you consider the next few years, and for the longer term, perhaps the next fifteen years, what would you say is your vision for what you might call, \u2018Future Food Systems\u2019?\n---\nMy vision for the future \u2013 I think sustainability is the key to anything.\n---\nIf we don\u2019t have sustainability, we\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nI want to bring more farmers on board, to grow our members; to see the benefits of what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nAnd also, to look at taking this \u2013 we\u2019ve just started off a 7.5kg bag line, it\u2019s a new thing for us, getting closer to the customer, and I think we\u2019ll look at something else to get closer to the customer really and cut the factories out, where we become further down the chain.\n---\nThe closer to the customer we get, the more we\u2019ll get back to the farm.\n---\nSo, ultimately you would have a process that would take the produce directly from the farm, straight to the end customer?\n---\nThat is the ultimate.\n---\nI think rather than just selling the potato, we\u2019ll slice it, and things like that.\n---\nOr we\u2019ll put it into ready-made meals.\n---\nWell maybe not that, but get it ready to go closer to the end user.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re sort of gradually, as you mentioned, bypassing elements of the chain, starting recently with going direct to consumer and that\u2019s the direction you want to take in the future?\n---\nI think one thing is the scale, we need to increase the volumes we trade as a group.\n---\nAnd on the other side we need an avenue where we get closer to the customer, to take the volatility out of the job.\n---\nAnd how do you feel this will contribute to sustainability?\nBecause you\u2019ve got [unclear] contracts in front of you.",
                    "contextualized_content": "The organization, referred to as [org name], consists of three farmers who specialize in potato cultivation. They are working collaboratively to centralize the purchasing and marketing of their potatoes, which allows them to streamline operations and reduce reliance on traditional middlemen. By bringing in a trader, they aim to alleviate the burden on individual farms and connect more directly with customers, who prefer dealing with an organization rather than multiple individual farms. This setup not only enhances efficiency but also ensures that profits are returned to the farmers, addressing a significant issue in the agricultural sector where farmers often see little of the profits generated from their produce. The organization operates primarily on a local level but also engages in regional and national supply, and occasionally exports to fill market gaps. Their innovative approach focuses on sustainability and direct sales to consumers, which they believe will further enhance their profitability and stability in the long term."

                    "original_content": "---\nThe factories, the customers \u2013 to be honest, the customers are quite happy paying a fair price for a good quality product.\n---\nThe problem is market prices \u2013 these dealers in the middle, and the factories, are really, when they can do, dropping the price for the farmers.\n---\nSo, we need to move closer to the end product where we can sustain a steady, average price for sustainability.\n---\nBecause in the last two years, we\u2019ve seen the base price collapse to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne.\n---\nAnd to give you an idea, we need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs, to break even.\n---\nAnd so, you can charge a fair price to the end customer whilst still getting enough profit to stay in business?\n---\nYes.\n---\nRight, good.\n---\nSo, we need to get close to then cut those rogues out the industry, really.\n---\nOkay, so it\u2019s cutting the rogues out.\n---\nSo, it sounds like you\u2019ve already taken the next step towards doing that by starting a direct-to-customer service?\n---\nYeah, that was done \u2013 we launched about four months\u2019 ago.\n---\nAnd this is basically the direction you\u2019re going in, to expand that part of the business?\n---\nIt\u2019s part of it yes.\n---\nObviously, there are different areas.\n---\nWe want more growers on board, more customers, and to grow that base we\u2019d need to add more of what we\u2019re doing and probably streamline what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s a three-way approach where we can drive out the inefficiencies, really.\n---\nAnd another thing, well as you know, things have changed quite recently \u2013 can you see any trends in society that could perhaps accelerate the vision that you\u2019ve just put forward, that might contribute to help?\n---\nObviously, COVID is a massive thing.\n---\nI do think there is more of an element of people wanting to know where it\u2019s come from.\n---\nAnd I think there is an element of people wanting that, but it\u2019s how you get the price and the customers to stop undermining everything we\u2019re doing in the UK, in the food industry.\n---\nBecause customers are willing to pay for it.\n---\nThey\u2019re willing to pay for quality.\n---\nBut, there\u2019s people within the system that will say, \u2018This is this,\u2019 but meanwhile bring some cheap stuff in the backdoor.\n---\nAnd that, as an industry, as a country, for food manufacturing areas we need to clamp down on.\n---\nI\u2019m wondering if Brexit is a factor?\n---\nIf it\u2019s harder to import things, would that be in your favour?\n---\nWell, it\u2019s harder to import things, definitely.\n---\nBut as a country we haven\u2019t got enough manufacturers to process the potatoes we have in the country anyway.\n---\nSo, we\u2019ve let it all go abroad, potatoes go to Belgium and then come back ready-made.\n---\nBut that might be more difficult.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s about developing manufacturing capacity to actually use what we already have?\n---\nWe use what here, we import a large amount of potatoes anyway, for ready-made meals and things like that.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the product to use, it\u2019s here in the country but we\u2019re not utilising it.\n---\nAnd the factories, the money has been invested in other countries, not the UK for processing potatoes.\n---\nAnd I know there\u2019s McCain\u2019s have reduced what they spend here, and [unclear \u2013 0:16:17:0] their major competitor take potatoes out of the UK, into Belgium, process them and they come back as a value pack for the supermarkets.\n---\nWhy are we allowing the road miles and everything else \u2013 it\u2019s crackers.\n---\nSo, it sounds like the bottle-neck is actually going to be processing capacity in the UK?\n---\nYes.\n---\nThe farmers are there, they\u2019ll do a good job.\n---\nThey\u2019re there to do it.\n---\nBut if they can\u2019t process what we produce, we\u2019re snookered.\n---\nWe\u2019re just flooding the market.\n---\nDo you think that [org name]  could actually, in any way, contribute towards helping with developing this processing capacity?\n---\nWe could, but the trouble with all these ideas is that they cost a lot of money.\n---\nAnd at a farm level, there isn\u2019t a lot of money left in the tank to be able to chuck at these things.\n---\nYou\u2019ve got to make your profits to then reinvest them.\n---\nAnd the banking industry is backing away from agriculture, because it\u2019s not seen as a very well \u2013 the profit margins are pathetic.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s building that to go forward.\n---\nMoney is key.\n---\nJust like a chicken and egg scenario, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nYes.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re aware of this issue but you might not be in a position personally to do much about it?\nExactly.\n---\nI can see the issue.\n---\nI know exactly what the issue is\n---\nand I know where you\u2019d take it forward.\n---\nBut without the investment or money to back what requires doing, it\u2019s a waste of time, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nSo, moving on a little bit more to financial issues, how resilient do you feel your organisation is?\n---\nHow stable do you think things might be, going forward in the next few years?\n---\nThe stability in [org name]  is fine.\n---\nThe stability in agriculture and farming is disastrous.\n---\nWithout the farmers and the potatoes, and supply what ever you\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not very stable.\n---\nThe problem is, manufacturing full stop.\n---\nIn this country I\u2019m hoping Brexit will change it but we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve got a good deal or a bad deal yet, do we?\n---\nIt\u2019s still evolving, yeah.\n---\nIt\u2019s a long way to go to get through this.\n---\nFarming is in a dire mess.\n---\nAnd that includes potatoes.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s not necessarily for the price, it\u2019s the weather patterns and everything.\n---\nIt\u2019s very, very difficult.\n---\nI\u2019m looking at things from two sides of the fence.\n---\nAnd so, which two sides?\n---\nThe side of the farmer, I\u2019ve a \u00a32 million turnover business farming.\n---\nAnd it\u2019s not paying.\n---\nAnd I\u2019m on the [org name] , the middle part of that is paying, but without farmers, you haven\u2019t got a business.\n---\nSo, this is basically the main risk, the whole farming industry in the UK after Brexit?\n---\nWe don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s going to go.\n---\nThere are very few farms in the last two or even three years that are actually profitable to a level that is satisfactory to a bank manager.\n---\nThat is worrying indeed.\n---\nAnd the banks are \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult for them to lend, if the business has a negative cash flow, through no fault of their own.\n---\nAnd there\u2019ll be a lot of businesses after COVID with the same scenario now.\n---\nWe\u2019ll come back to COVID in a moment, but in your answer to business and in [org name] , what sort of contingency plans to you have for the next few years, to deal with these risks?\n---\nThe contingency plan for the farm side of things is basically reduce what I\u2019m doing, because I cannot risk the losses.\n---\nSo, I\u2019m actually downscaling what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nReducing the farm size.\n---\nNow I\u2019m in my late 30\u2019s (nearly 40!), I should really be pushing things on.\n---\nYeah, building things up, developing them, yeah.\n---\nDeveloping, and actually, we doing quite the opposite.\n---\nI\u2019m doing the less.\n---\nFrom the [org name]  point of view, basically, I\u2019m getting more growers on board and spreading the risk out to more growers.\n---\nSo, the more growers we get, the less at risk we are.\n---\nSo, can reduce risk on the [org name]  side by diversifying, bringing in more growers, and on the farm side all you can do is down scale to a point at which you feel you can operate?\nWhich is downscale to a point at which it\u2019s manageable and we can guarantee sales through all of our products we produce.\n---\nWhat else can you do?\n---\nI\u2019m going to be here in the future.\n---\nYes, you\u2019re just not quite sure how.\n---\nThat\u2019s all rather worrying.",
                    "contextualized_content": "The factories, the customers \u2013 to be honest, the customers are quite happy paying a fair price for a good quality product. However, the problem lies in market prices, where dealers in the middle and factories often drop the price for farmers when they can. This creates a need to move closer to the end product to sustain a steady, average price for sustainability. In the last two years, the base price has collapsed to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne, while farmers need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs and break even. The organization aims to charge a fair price to the end customer while ensuring enough profit to stay in business, which is crucial for their sustainability efforts. \n\nTo achieve this, they recognize the necessity of cutting out the \"rogues\" in the industry and have already taken steps towards this by launching a direct-to-customer service about four months ago. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to expand their business, attract more growers and customers, and streamline operations to drive out inefficiencies. The speaker notes that societal trends, particularly post-COVID, indicate a growing consumer interest in knowing the origins of their food, which could further support their vision. However, they also acknowledge the challenges posed by Brexit, particularly regarding the lack of processing capacity in the UK, which has led to a reliance on importing processed products. \n\nThe organization is aware of the financial constraints within the agricultural sector, as the banking industry has been hesitant to invest due to low profit margins. They emphasize the need for investment to develop processing capacity and ensure that farmers can effectively utilize their produce. The speaker expresses concern about the overall stability of agriculture in the UK, especially in light of recent challenges, and highlights the importance of diversifying their grower base to mitigate risks."

                    "original_content": "Could you say a little bit about your organisation\u2019s activities?\n---\nWhen you say that, do you mean the farm side or the [org name] ?\n---\nI think the [org name].\n---\n[org name] is 3 farmers, we all grow potatoes.\n---\nWe are all selling individually, and what we\u2019re trying to do is come together to make an organisation basically, where all our potatoes are bought centrally and marketed all together.\n---\nSo, fundamentally, we brought in a trader to take the burden out of the individual farms and get closer to the customers, because the customers don\u2019t really want to deal with the farms, they would rather go through an organisation.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s like an interface between the farmers and the customers?\n---\nYes, basically, somewhere in the middle it\u2019s owned by the farmers.\n---\nSet up for the farmers.\n---\nAnd the idea is by taking the middle man out, we are the middle man.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re taking the middle man out from between the farmers and the market?\n---\nYes.\n---\nWe are the traders in the middle.\n---\nThat\u2019s great.\n---\nWhat\u2019s your personal involvement in this?\n---\nWhat role do you play?\n---\nWhen the factory wants loads, well, rather than going to individual farms, we manage their supply into the factory.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s about ten-fifteen farms, supplying in.\n---\nAnd we manage that supply so that there\u2019s a steady supply of potatoes rather than odds and sods here and there.\n---\nThen obviously, they pay [org name]  and [org name]  distributes the money out to the farmers.\n---\nSo, I believe you operate on a local level?\n---\nThe main core of the group is local.\n---\nBut then we do supply factories all over the country.\n---\nAnd we buy potatoes from all over the country as well, on an ad hoc basis, so we can supply all year round because potatoes arrive at different periods of the year.\n---\nAnd obviously, we want to supply the factories all year round, and they want a supply all year round.\n---\nSo, we buy from other farms as well, which supply at different times of year, it varies.\n---\nIs this nationally, or do you do anything with factories or suppliers in other countries?\n---\nWe do a little bit.\n---\nWe have exported in the past.\n---\nNot much this year.\n---\nLast year we were exporting and importing.\n---\nBut it\u2019s only really to fill any gaps.\n---\nWhen we have extreme heat, or anything like that, we just fill in gaps when there\u2019s surplus, things like that.\n---\nSo, you operate locally, regionally and nationally.\n---\nBut internationally when you have to, when there\u2019s a gap?\n---\nYeah, when there are too many potatoes here, we have exported to Poland, exported to Ireland and Belgium quite a bit.\n---\nBut that\u2019s not a regular thing, that\u2019s just when the market requires it, if there\u2019s an opportunity we have to grab it.\n---\nHow would you consider yourself to be innovative?\n---\nWhat do you feel you are doing differently?\n---\nInitially we had to go through somewhere else other than [org name] and there is a lot of money in the middle man.\n---\nAnd basically, the idea was that we cut out the middle man and all that money comes back to the farm.\n---\nSo, we\u2019re not there to make money, we\u2019re there to pass the money back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that is the crux of the industry that has not been happening.\n---\nThe money going back to farmers \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s not been happening?\n---\nIt\u2019s not been going back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s what you aim to address?\n---\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to deal with.\n---\nAnd since we\u2019ve become in the area, doing what we\u2019re doing, these other mergers in the middle are taking the mass market out because they have to compete.\n---\nSo, are you saying there\u2019s now competition?\n---\nThere\u2019s more competition in the area.\n---\nSo, people have seen that it\u2019s a good idea and they want in on it?\n---\nYes, as it were.\n---\nI\u2019ve just obeyed the company really.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got a lot to do, to get to where we want to get to.\n---\nIt\u2019s certainly helping.\n---\nObviously, after Covid it\u2019s been a challenging year.\nIndeed.\n---\nSo, in terms of collaborators \u2013 well you\u2019ve touched on competition, but considering who you\u2019re collaborating with at the moment, there\u2019s the three farms and other suppliers?\n---\nThere\u2019s three farms that are direct suppliers, and then we have contractual other farms, basically guaranteeing us their spuds, contracted into the group.\n---\nAnd we supply factories like Walkers, McCains, Seabrooks \u2013 various crisps, all those sorts of people.\n---\n[unclear] Food, we do a little bit of pre-packaged for supermarkets with Morrison\u2019s and different people.\n---\n[unclear 0:08:51.0]\nAnd you\u2019ve explained that your role in this network is bypassing the middle man and making sure that the most profit goes from the customers back to the farmers?\n---\nYes, basically.\n---\nWho amongst the people you\u2019re working with, who are crucial?\n---\nWith the other people who you\u2019ve mentioned, who you\u2019re collaborating with, are they all crucial to the functioning of [org name] ?\n---\nNo, not the day-to-day running of it.\n---\nI\u2019m obviously managing the office with staff.\n---\nThey are obviously directors of the business, interested in how it works, but the day-to-day management comes back to me and the staff.\n---\nIs that what you mean?\n---\nYes, so what you\u2019re saying is that if a supplier dropped out, you could find a different supplier, and things like that?\n---\nYes, obviously the crucial thing is suppliers and farmers.\n---\nIf you haven\u2019t got them, or enough of them to supply the demand you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nSo, they\u2019re the important ones?\n---\nYes.\n---\nPlus, of course, the people who like yourself, are actually running the organisation, running the outfit?\n---\nWho\u2019s crucial within who runs it?\n---\nI think you just mentioned the people who are managing it?\n---\nYeah, that\u2019s me, we\u2019re the crucial ones.\n---\nWell, if we don\u2019t do what we do then someone else will do it.\n---\nBut yeah, we are the ones making it work.\n---\nSo, I think, looking a little bit towards the future, if you consider the next few years, and for the longer term, perhaps the next fifteen years, what would you say is your vision for what you might call, \u2018Future Food Systems\u2019?\n---\nMy vision for the future \u2013 I think sustainability is the key to anything.\n---\nIf we don\u2019t have sustainability, we\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nI want to bring more farmers on board, to grow our members; to see the benefits of what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nAnd also, to look at taking this \u2013 we\u2019ve just started off a 7.5kg bag line, it\u2019s a new thing for us, getting closer to the customer, and I think we\u2019ll look at something else to get closer to the customer really and cut the factories out, where we become further down the chain.\n---\nThe closer to the customer we get, the more we\u2019ll get back to the farm.\n---\nSo, ultimately you would have a process that would take the produce directly from the farm, straight to the end customer?\n---\nThat is the ultimate.\n---\nI think rather than just selling the potato, we\u2019ll slice it, and things like that.\n---\nOr we\u2019ll put it into ready-made meals.\n---\nWell maybe not that, but get it ready to go closer to the end user.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re sort of gradually, as you mentioned, bypassing elements of the chain, starting recently with going direct to consumer and that\u2019s the direction you want to take in the future?\n---\nI think one thing is the scale, we need to increase the volumes we trade as a group.\n---\nAnd on the other side we need an avenue where we get closer to the customer, to take the volatility out of the job.\n---\nAnd how do you feel this will contribute to sustainability?\nBecause you\u2019ve got [unclear] contracts in front of you.",
                    "contextualized_content": "The organization, referred to as [org name], consists of three farmers who specialize in potato cultivation. They are working collaboratively to centralize the purchasing and marketing of their potatoes, which allows them to streamline operations and reduce reliance on traditional middlemen. By bringing in a trader, they aim to alleviate the burden on individual farms and connect more directly with customers, who prefer dealing with an organization rather than multiple individual farms. This setup not only enhances efficiency but also ensures that profits are returned to the farmers, addressing a significant issue in the agricultural sector where farmers often see little of the profits generated from their produce. The organization operates primarily on a local level but also engages in regional and national supply, and occasionally exports to fill market gaps. Their innovative approach focuses on sustainability and direct sales to consumers, which they believe will further enhance their profitability and stability in the long term."

organisation?\n---\n[org name] , as an organisation, we had contracts \u2013 our customers basically tore up in front of us.\n---\nFor supply, we\u2019ve basically not been able to move the tonnage required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped.\n---\nAnd I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector.\n---\nSo, all of a sudden, we had a lot of potatoes sat there with no homes.\n---\nThat was a major effect.\n---\nTo the point after the lockdown now, this sector doesn\u2019t require the potatoes.\n---\nAnd we\u2019re planning now for 2021/2022 harvest and to be quite honest we\u2019ve got customers who won\u2019t sign a contract with us until they know more about what is going to happen.\n---\nBut as a

tonnes of potatoes in the ground and in sheds which will not get processed or used.\n---\nThey\u2019ll just get wasted.\n---\nI wonder if the Direct to Customer service could help here?\n---\nIf you

pasta.\n---\nCertainly, don\u2019t want to be importing stuff, which is what\u2019s coming up.\n---\nSo, if you want to help the British farmers, the supermarkets, the factories need to stop importing stuff.\n---\nAnd start taking things from British suppliers.\n---\nSo, is [org name]  a suitable venue to publicise this, to actually say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got all this stuff, you don\u2019t need to go abroad\u2019?\n---\nWell, it is, but we\u2019re probably not a big enough player.\n---\nWhen you\u2019re talking to the likes of McCain\u2019s, and Walkers, and those sorts of people, they\u2019re a multinational company anyway, they have suppliers from all over the place.\n---\nIt\u2019s got to come from government level really, to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019\n---\nOr the supermarkets, the customers.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not the public, it is the supermarkets.\n---\nAnd the government has got to say, \u2018No, enough is enough.\u2019\n---\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID?\n---\nAnything at all?\n---\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes \u2013 that side of things has done very well on the back of it.\n---\nSo, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s good.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not to the same scale as what we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\n---\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re not going to go quite back to the way you were before?\n---\nIt\u2019s going to be different?\n---\nIt\u2019ll certainly be different.\n---\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\n---\nYeah, it\u2019s killing agriculture big style.\n---\nIf all the manufacturers stop, it\u2019ll kill it.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s all very worrying.\n---\nWell, I hope things get better for you.\n---\nI\u2019ve come to the end of my questions now, you\u2019ve shed a lot of insight into what\u2019s sort of happening in this situation.\n---\nI wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\n---\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\n---\nWe\u2019ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that.\n---\nFind out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI think there are two-three solutions to the problem.\n---\nOne, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to.\n---\nI think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back.\n---\nAnd these food miles are absolutely nuts.\n---\nIt\u2019s mad.\n---\nAnd yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nWe\u2019ll have no business left.\n---\nThe banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\n---\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really!\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down.\n---\nBut I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves.\n---\nWe need to be able survive\n---\nand we need to be competitive.\n---\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\n---\nYes.\n---\nAnd the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot.\n---\nPut it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\n---\nThat seems very clear.\n---\nAs we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\n---\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\n---\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s more money coming back to the farm.\n---\nEND",

With contracts being abruptly canceled, the organization faced a significant challenge in moving the required tonnage of potatoes, particularly as one-third of the potato industry supplies the food sector, which includes restaurants that suddenly ceased operations. This left a surplus of potatoes with no market, leading to concerns about waste and financial losses. As they plan for the upcoming harvest, uncertainty looms as customers hesitate to commit to contracts, creating a precarious situation for farmers who must continue planting without guaranteed sales. \n\nDespite these challenges, there have been some positive developments, such as the growth of small outlets and online sales, which have gained traction during the pandemic. However, the overall landscape remains daunting, with the combination of COVID and Brexit posing significant threats to the agricultural industry.

sustain a steady, average price for sustainability.\n---\nBecause in the last two years, we\u2019ve seen the base price collapse to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne.\n---\nAnd to give you an idea, we need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs, to break even.\n---\nAnd so, you can charge a fair price to the end customer whilst still getting enough profit to stay in business?\n---\nYes.\n---\nRight, good.\n---\nSo, we need to get close to then cut those rogues out the industry, really.\n---\nOkay, so it\u2019s cutting the rogues out.\n---\nSo, it sounds like you\u2019ve already taken the next step towards doing that by starting a direct-to-customer service?\n---\nYeah, that was done \u2013 we launched about four months\u2019 ago.\n---\nAnd this is basically the direction you\u2019re going in, to expand that part of the business?\n---\nIt\u2019s part of it yes.\n---\nObviously, there are different areas.\n---\nWe want more growers on board, more customers, and to grow that base we\u2019d need to add more of what we\u2019re doing and probably streamline what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s a three-way approach where we can drive out the inefficiencies, really.\n---\nAnd another thing, well as you know, things have changed quite recently \u2013 can you see any trends in society that could perhaps accelerate the vision that you\u2019ve just put forward, that might contribute to help?\n---\nObviously, COVID is a massive thing.\n---\nI do think there is more of an element of people wanting to know where it\u2019s come from.\n---\nAnd I think there is an element of people wanting that, but it\u2019s how you get the price and the customers to stop undermining everything we\u2019re doing in the UK, in the food industry.\n---\nBecause customers are willing to pay for it.\n---\nThey\u2019re willing to pay for quality.\n---\nBut, there\u2019s people within the system that will say, \u2018This is this,\u2019 but meanwhile bring some cheap stuff in the backdoor.\n---\nAnd that, as an industry, as a country, for food manufacturing areas we need to clamp down on.\n---\nI\u2019m wondering if Brexit is a factor?\n---\nIf it\u2019s harder to import things, would that be in your favour?\n---\nWell, it\u2019s harder to import things, definitely.\n---\nBut as a country we haven\u2019t got enough manufacturers to process the potatoes we have in the country anyway.\n---\nSo, we\u2019ve let it all go abroad, potatoes go to Belgium and then come back ready-made.\n---\nBut that might be more difficult.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s about developing manufacturing capacity to actually use what we already have?\n---\nWe use what here, we import a large amount of potatoes anyway, for ready-made meals and things like that.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the product to use, it\u2019s here in the country but we\u2019re not utilising it.\n---\nAnd the factories, the money has been invested in other countries, not the UK for processing potatoes.\n---\nAnd I know there\u2019s McCain\u2019s have reduced what they spend here, and [unclear \u2013 0:16:17:0] their major competitor take potatoes out of the UK, into Belgium, process them and they come back as a value pack for the supermarkets.\n---\nWhy are we allowing the road miles and everything else \u2013 it\u2019s crackers.\n---\nSo, it sounds like the bottle-neck is actually going to be processing capacity in the UK?\n---\nYes.\n---\nThe farmers are there, they\u2019ll do a good job.\n---\nThey\u2019re there to do it.\n---\nBut if they can\u2019t process what we produce, we\u2019re snookered.\n---\nWe\u2019re just flooding the market.\n---\nDo you think that [org name]  could actually, in any way, contribute towards helping with developing this processing capacity?\n---\nWe could, but the trouble with all these ideas is that they cost a lot of money.\n---\nAnd at a farm level, there isn\u2019t a lot of money left in the tank to be able to chuck at these things.\n---\nYou\u2019ve got to make your profits to then reinvest them.\n---\nAnd the banking industry is backing away from agriculture, because it\u2019s not seen as a very well \u2013 the profit margins are pathetic.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s building that to go forward.\n---\nMoney is key.\n---\nJust like a chicken and egg scenario, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nYes.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re aware of this issue but you might not be in a position personally to do much about it?\nExactly.\n---\nI can see the issue.\n---\nI know exactly what the issue is\n---\nand I know where you\u2019d take it forward.\n---\nBut without the investment or money to back what requires doing, it\u2019s a waste of time, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nSo, moving on a little bit more to financial issues, how resilient do you feel your organisation is?\n---\nHow stable do you think things might be, going forward in the next few years?\n---\nThe stability in [org name]  is fine.\n---\nThe stability in agriculture and farming is disastrous.\n---\nWithout the farmers and the potatoes, and supply what ever you\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not very stable.\n---\nThe problem is, manufacturing full stop.\n---\nIn this country I\u2019m hoping Brexit will change it but we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve got a good deal or a bad deal yet, do we?\n---\nIt\u2019s still evolving, yeah.\n---\nIt\u2019s a long way to go to get through this.\n---\nFarming is in a dire mess.\n---\nAnd that includes potatoes.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s not necessarily for the price, it\u2019s the weather patterns and everything.\n---\nIt\u2019s very, very difficult.\n---\nI\u2019m looking at things from two sides of the fence.\n---\nAnd so, which two sides?\n---\nThe side of the farmer, I\u2019ve a \u00a32 million turnover business farming.\n---\nAnd it\u2019s not paying.\n---\nAnd I\u2019m on the [org name] , the middle part of that is paying, but without farmers, you haven\u2019t got a business.\n---\nSo, this is basically the main risk, the whole farming industry in the UK after Brexit?\n---\nWe don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s going to go.\n---\nThere are very few farms in the last two or even three years that are actually profitable to a level that is satisfactory to a bank manager.\n---\nThat is worrying indeed.\n---\nAnd the banks are \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult for them to lend, if the business has a negative cash flow, through no fault of their own.\n---\nAnd there\u2019ll be a lot of businesses after COVID with the same scenario now.\n---\nWe\u2019ll come back to COVID in a moment, but in your answer to business and in [org name] , what sort of contingency plans to you have for the next few years, to deal with these risks?\n---\nThe contingency plan for the farm side of things is basically reduce what I\u2019m doing, because I cannot risk the losses.\n---\nSo, I\u2019m actually downscaling what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nReducing the farm size.\n---\nNow I\u2019m in my late 30\u2019s (nearly 40!), I should really be pushing things on.\n---\nYeah, building things up, developing them, yeah.\n---\nDeveloping, and actually, we doing quite the opposite.\n---\nI\u2019m doing the less.\n---\nFrom the [org name]  point of view, basically, I\u2019m getting more growers on board and spreading the risk out to more growers.\n---\nSo, the more growers we get, the less at risk we are.\n---\nSo, can reduce risk on the [org name]  side by diversifying, bringing in more growers, and on the farm side all you can do is down scale to a point at which you feel you can operate?\nWhich is downscale to a point at which it\u2019s manageable and we can guarantee sales through all of our products we produce.\n---\nWhat else can you do?\n---\nI\u2019m going to be here in the future.\n---\nYes, you\u2019re just not quite sure how.\n---\nThat\u2019s all rather worrying.",

This initiative is part of a broader strategy to expand their business, attract more growers and customers, and streamline operations to drive out inefficiencies. The speaker notes that societal trends, particularly post-COVID, indicate a growing consumer interest in knowing the origins of their food, which could further support their vision. However, they also acknowledge the challenges posed by Brexit, particularly regarding the lack of processing capacity in the UK, which has led to a reliance on importing processed products. \n\nThe organization is aware of the financial constraints within the agricultural sector, as the banking industry has been hesitant to invest due to low profit margins. They emphasize the need for investment to develop processing capacity and ensure that farmers can effectively utilize their produce. The speaker expresses concern about the overall stability of agriculture in the UK, especially in light of recent challenges, and highlights the importance of diversifying their grower base to mitigate risks."

organisation?\n---\n[org name] , as an organisation, we had contracts \u2013 our customers basically tore up in front of us.\n---\nFor supply, we\u2019ve basically not been able to move the tonnage required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped.\n---\nAnd I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector.\n---\nSo, all of a sudden, we had a lot of potatoes sat there with no homes.\n---\nThat was a major effect.\n---\nTo the point after the lockdown now, this sector doesn\u2019t require the potatoes.\n---\nAnd we\u2019re planning now for 2021/2022 harvest and to be quite honest we\u2019ve got customers who won\u2019t sign a contract with us until they know more about what is going to happen.\n---\nBut as a farmer, you have to buy the seed, you have to plant the potatoes, you can\u2019t stop.\n---\nBut the customers are just saying, \u2018Well, not sure.\n---\nPlant them \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know later in the year whether we\u2019re going to take them or not.\u2019\n---\nAre you fearing you might end up with a pile of potatoes you can\u2019t sell to anybody?\nAbsolutely.\n---\nThousands of tonnes of potatoes in the ground and in sheds which will not get processed or used.\n---\nThey\u2019ll just get wasted.\n---\nI wonder if the Direct to Customer service could help here?\n---\nIf you could get some straight to the customers, would that help?\n---\nThere is an element of that, but there are a lot of people who don\u2019t use potatoes \u2013 the cooking at home is rice, it\u2019s pasta.\n---\nCertainly, don\u2019t want to be importing stuff, which is what\u2019s coming up.\n---\nSo, if you want to help the British farmers, the supermarkets, the factories need to stop importing stuff.\n---\nAnd start taking things from British suppliers.\n---\nSo, is [org name]  a suitable venue to publicise this, to actually say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got all this stuff, you don\u2019t need to go abroad\u2019?\n---\nWell, it is, but we\u2019re probably not a big enough player.\n---\nWhen you\u2019re talking to the likes of McCain\u2019s, and Walkers, and those sorts of people, they\u2019re a multinational company anyway, they have suppliers from all over the place.\n---\nIt\u2019s got to come from government level really, to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019\n---\nOr the supermarkets, the customers.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not the public, it is the supermarkets.\n---\nAnd the government has got to say, \u2018No, enough is enough.\u2019\n---\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID?\n---\nAnything at all?\n---\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes \u2013 that side of things has done very well on the back of it.\n---\nSo, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s good.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not to the same scale as what we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\n---\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re not going to go quite back to the way you were before?\n---\nIt\u2019s going to be different?\n---\nIt\u2019ll certainly be different.\n---\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\n---\nYeah, it\u2019s killing agriculture big style.\n---\nIf all the manufacturers stop, it\u2019ll kill it.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s all very worrying.\n---\nWell, I hope things get better for you.\n---\nI\u2019ve come to the end of my questions now, you\u2019ve shed a lot of insight into what\u2019s sort of happening in this situation.\n---\nI wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\n---\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\n---\nWe\u2019ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that.\n---\nFind out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI think there are two-three solutions to the problem.\n---\nOne, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to.\n---\nI think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back.\n---\nAnd these food miles are absolutely nuts.\n---\nIt\u2019s mad.\n---\nAnd yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nWe\u2019ll have no business left.\n---\nThe banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\n---\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really!\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down.\n---\nBut I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves.\n---\nWe need to be able survive\n---\nand we need to be competitive.\n---\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\n---\nYes.\n---\nAnd the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot.\n---\nPut it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\n---\nThat seems very clear.\n---\nAs we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\n---\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\n---\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s more money coming back to the farm.\n---\nEND",
                    "contextualized_content": "The COVID crisis has had a profound impact on [org name] and the agricultural sector as a whole. With contracts being abruptly canceled, the organization faced a significant challenge in moving the required tonnage of potatoes, particularly as one-third of the potato industry supplies the food sector, which includes restaurants that suddenly ceased operations. This left a surplus of potatoes with no market, leading to concerns about waste and financial losses. As they plan for the upcoming harvest, uncertainty looms as customers hesitate to commit to contracts, creating a precarious situation for farmers who must continue planting without guaranteed sales. \n\nDespite these challenges, there have been some positive developments, such as the growth of small outlets and online sales, which have gained traction during the pandemic. However, the overall landscape remains daunting, with the combination of COVID and Brexit posing significant threats to the agricultural industry. The speaker emphasizes the need for local sourcing and investment to create a more resilient food system, advocating for a reduction in food miles and a more efficient distribution of resources to support farmers and ensure sustainability."

                    "original_content": "Could you say a little bit about your organisation\u2019s activities?\n---\nWhen you say that, do you mean the farm side or the [org name] ?\n---\nI think the [org name].\n---\n[org name] is 3 farmers, we all grow potatoes.\n---\nWe are all selling individually, and what we\u2019re trying to do is come together to make an organisation basically, where all our potatoes are bought centrally and marketed all together.\n---\nSo, fundamentally, we brought in a trader to take the burden out of the individual farms and get closer to the customers, because the customers don\u2019t really want to deal with the farms, they would rather go through an organisation.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s like an interface between the farmers and the customers?\n---\nYes, basically, somewhere in the middle it\u2019s owned by the farmers.\n---\nSet up for the farmers.\n---\nAnd the idea is by taking the middle man out, we are the middle man.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re taking the middle man out from between the farmers and the market?\n---\nYes.\n---\nWe are the traders in the middle.\n---\nThat\u2019s great.\n---\nWhat\u2019s your personal involvement in this?\n---\nWhat role do you play?\n---\nWhen the factory wants loads, well, rather than going to individual farms, we manage their supply into the factory.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s about ten-fifteen farms, supplying in.\n---\nAnd we manage that supply so that there\u2019s a steady supply of potatoes rather than odds and sods here and there.\n---\nThen obviously, they pay [org name]  and [org name]  distributes the money out to the farmers.\n---\nSo, I believe you operate on a local level?\n---\nThe main core of the group is local.\n---\nBut then we do supply factories all over the country.\n---\nAnd we buy potatoes from all over the country as well, on an ad hoc basis, so we can supply all year round because potatoes arrive at different periods of the year.\n---\nAnd obviously, we want to supply the factories all year round, and they want a supply all year round.\n---\nSo, we buy from other farms as well, which supply at different times of year, it varies.\n---\nIs this nationally, or do you do anything with factories or suppliers in other countries?\n---\nWe do a little bit.\n---\nWe have exported in the past.\n---\nNot much this year.\n---\nLast year we were exporting and importing.\n---\nBut it\u2019s only really to fill any gaps.\n---\nWhen we have extreme heat, or anything like that, we just fill in gaps when there\u2019s surplus, things like that.\n---\nSo, you operate locally, regionally and nationally.\n---\nBut internationally when you have to, when there\u2019s a gap?\n---\nYeah, when there are too many potatoes here, we have exported to Poland, exported to Ireland and Belgium quite a bit.\n---\nBut that\u2019s not a regular thing, that\u2019s just when the market requires it, if there\u2019s an opportunity we have to grab it.\n---\nHow would you consider yourself to be innovative?\n---\nWhat do you feel you are doing differently?\n---\nInitially we had to go through somewhere else other than [org name] and there is a lot of money in the middle man.\n---\nAnd basically, the idea was that we cut out the middle man and all that money comes back to the farm.\n---\nSo, we\u2019re not there to make money, we\u2019re there to pass the money back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that is the crux of the industry that has not been happening.\n---\nThe money going back to farmers \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s not been happening?\n---\nIt\u2019s not been going back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s what you aim to address?\n---\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to deal with.\n---\nAnd since we\u2019ve become in the area, doing what we\u2019re doing, these other mergers in the middle are taking the mass market out because they have to compete.\n---\nSo, are you saying there\u2019s now competition?\n---\nThere\u2019s more competition in the area.\n---\nSo, people have seen that it\u2019s a good idea and they want in on it?\n---\nYes, as it were.\n---\nI\u2019ve just obeyed the company really.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got a lot to do, to get to where we want to get to.\n---\nIt\u2019s certainly helping.\n---\nObviously, after Covid it\u2019s been a challenging year.\nIndeed.\n---\nSo, in terms of collaborators \u2013 well you\u2019ve touched on competition, but considering who you\u2019re collaborating with at the moment, there\u2019s the three farms and other suppliers?\n---\nThere\u2019s three farms that are direct suppliers, and then we have contractual other farms, basically guaranteeing us their spuds, contracted into the group.\n---\nAnd we supply factories like Walkers, McCains, Seabrooks \u2013 various crisps, all those sorts of people.\n---\n[unclear] Food, we do a little bit of pre-packaged for supermarkets with Morrison\u2019s and different people.\n---\n[unclear 0:08:51.0]\nAnd you\u2019ve explained that your role in this network is bypassing the middle man and making sure that the most profit goes from the customers back to the farmers?\n---\nYes, basically.\n---\nWho amongst the people you\u2019re working with, who are crucial?\n---\nWith the other people who you\u2019ve mentioned, who you\u2019re collaborating with, are they all crucial to the functioning of [org name] ?\n---\nNo, not the day-to-day running of it.\n---\nI\u2019m obviously managing the office with staff.\n---\nThey are obviously directors of the business, interested in how it works, but the day-to-day management comes back to me and the staff.\n---\nIs that what you mean?\n---\nYes, so what you\u2019re saying is that if a supplier dropped out, you could find a different supplier, and things like that?\n---\nYes, obviously the crucial thing is suppliers and farmers.\n---\nIf you haven\u2019t got them, or enough of them to supply the demand you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nSo, they\u2019re the important ones?\n---\nYes.\n---\nPlus, of course, the people who like yourself, are actually running the organisation, running the outfit?\n---\nWho\u2019s crucial within who runs it?\n---\nI think you just mentioned the people who are managing it?\n---\nYeah, that\u2019s me, we\u2019re the crucial ones.\n---\nWell, if we don\u2019t do what we do then someone else will do it.\n---\nBut yeah, we are the ones making it work.\n---\nSo, I think, looking a little bit towards the future, if you consider the next few years, and for the longer term, perhaps the next fifteen years, what would you say is your vision for what you might call, \u2018Future Food Systems\u2019?\n---\nMy vision for the future \u2013 I think sustainability is the key to anything.\n---\nIf we don\u2019t have sustainability, we\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nI want to bring more farmers on board, to grow our members; to see the benefits of what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nAnd

organisation?\n---\n[org name] , as an organisation, we had contracts \u2013 our customers basically tore up in front of us.\n---\nFor supply, we\u2019ve basically not been able to move the tonnage required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped.\n---\nAnd I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector.\n---\nSo, all of a sudden, we had a lot of potatoes sat there with no homes.\n---\nThat was a major effect.\n---\nTo the point after the lockdown now, this sector doesn\u2019t require the potatoes.\n---\nAnd we\u2019re planning now for 2021/2022 harvest and to be quite honest we\u2019ve got customers who won\u2019t sign a contract with us until they know more about what is going to happen.\n---\nBut as a farmer, you have to buy the seed, you have to plant the potatoes, you can\u2019t stop.\n---\nBut the customers are just saying, \u2018Well, not sure.\n---\nPlant them \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know later in the year whether we\u2019re going to take them or not.\u2019\n---\nAre you fearing you might end up with a pile of potatoes you can\u2019t sell to anybody?\nAbsolutely.\n---\nThousands of tonnes of potatoes in the ground and in sheds which will not get processed or used.\n---\nThey\u2019ll just get wasted.\n---\nI wonder if the Direct to Customer service could help here?\n---\nIf you could get some straight to the customers, would that help?\n---\nThere is an element of that, but there are a lot of people who don\u2019t use potatoes \u2013 the cooking at home is rice, it\u2019s pasta.\n---\nCertainly, don\u2019t want to be importing stuff, which is what\u2019s coming up.\n---\nSo, if you want to help the British farmers, the supermarkets, the factories need to stop importing stuff.\n---\nAnd start taking things from British suppliers.\n---\nSo, is [org name]  a suitable venue to publicise this, to actually say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got all this stuff, you don\u2019t need to go abroad\u2019?\n---\nWell, it is, but we\u2019re probably not a big enough player.\n---\nWhen you\u2019re talking to the likes of McCain\u2019s, and Walkers, and those sorts of people, they\u2019re a multinational company anyway, they have suppliers from all over the place.\n---\nIt\u2019s got to come from government level really, to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019\n---\nOr the supermarkets, the customers.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not the public, it is the supermarkets.\n---\nAnd the government has got to say, \u2018No, enough is enough.\u2019\n---\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID?\n---\nAnything at all?\n---\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes \u2013 that side of things has done very well on the back of it.\n---\nSo, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s good.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not to the same scale as what we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\n---\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re not going to go quite back to the way you were before?\n---\nIt\u2019s going to be different?\n---\nIt\u2019ll certainly be different.\n---\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\n---\nYeah, it\u2019s killing agriculture big style.\n---\nIf all the manufacturers stop, it\u2019ll kill it.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s all very worrying.\n---\nWell, I hope things get better for you.\n---\nI\u2019ve come to the end of my questions now, you\u2019ve shed a lot of insight into what\u2019s sort of happening in this situation.\n---\nI wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\n---\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\n---\nWe\u2019ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that.\n---\nFind out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI think there are two-three solutions to the problem.\n---\nOne, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to.\n---\nI think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back.\n---\nAnd these food miles are absolutely nuts.\n---\nIt\u2019s mad.\n---\nAnd yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nWe\u2019ll have no business left.\n---\nThe banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\n---\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really!\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down.\n---\nBut I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves.\n---\nWe need to be able survive\n---\nand we need to be competitive.\n---\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\n---\nYes.\n---\nAnd the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot.\n---\nPut it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\n---\nThat seems very clear.\n---\nAs we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\n---\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\n---\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s more money coming back to the farm.\n---\nEND",
                    "contextualized_content": "The COVID crisis has had a profound impact on [org name] and the agricultural sector as a whole. With contracts being abruptly canceled, the organization faced a significant challenge in moving the required tonnage of potatoes, particularly as one-third of the potato industry supplies the food sector, which includes restaurants that suddenly ceased operations. This left a surplus of potatoes with no market, leading to concerns about waste and financial losses. As they plan for the upcoming harvest, uncertainty looms as customers hesitate to commit to contracts, creating a precarious situation for farmers who must continue planting without guaranteed sales. \n\nDespite these challenges, there have been some positive developments, such as the growth of small outlets and online sales, which have gained traction during the pandemic. However, the overall landscape remains daunting, with the combination of COVID and Brexit posing significant threats to the agricultural industry. The speaker emphasizes the need for local sourcing and investment to create a more resilient food system, advocating for a reduction in food miles and a more efficient distribution of resources to support farmers and ensure sustainability."

                    "original_content": "Could you say a little bit about your organisation\u2019s activities?\n---\nWhen you say that, do you mean the farm side or the [org name] ?\n---\nI think the [org name].\n---\n[org name] is 3 farmers, we all grow potatoes.\n---\nWe are all selling individually, and what we\u2019re trying to do is come together to make an organisation basically, where all our potatoes are bought centrally and marketed all together.\n---\nSo, fundamentally, we brought in a trader to take the burden out of the individual farms and get closer to the customers, because the customers don\u2019t really want to deal with the farms, they would rather go through an organisation.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s like an interface between the farmers and the customers?\n---\nYes, basically, somewhere in the middle it\u2019s owned by the farmers.\n---\nSet up for the farmers.\n---\nAnd the idea is by taking the middle man out, we are the middle man.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re taking the middle man out from between the farmers and the market?\n---\nYes.\n---\nWe are the traders in the middle.\n---\nThat\u2019s great.\n---\nWhat\u2019s your personal involvement in this?\n---\nWhat role do you play?\n---\nWhen the factory wants loads, well, rather than going to individual farms, we manage their supply into the factory.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s about ten-fifteen farms, supplying in.\n---\nAnd we manage that supply so that there\u2019s a steady supply of potatoes rather than odds and sods here and there.\n---\nThen obviously, they pay [org name]  and [org name]  distributes the money out to the farmers.\n---\nSo, I believe you operate on a local level?\n---\nThe main core of the group is local.\n---\nBut then we do supply factories all over the country.\n---\nAnd we buy potatoes from all over the country as well, on an ad hoc basis, so we can supply all year round because potatoes arrive at different periods of the year.\n---\nAnd obviously, we want to supply the factories all year round, and they want a supply all year round.\n---\nSo, we buy from other farms as well, which supply at different times of year, it varies.\n---\nIs this nationally, or do you do anything with factories or suppliers in other countries?\n---\nWe do a little bit.\n---\nWe have exported in the past.\n---\nNot much this year.\n---\nLast year we were exporting and importing.\n---\nBut it\u2019s only really to fill any gaps.\n---\nWhen we have extreme heat, or anything like that, we just fill in gaps when there\u2019s surplus, things like that.\n---\nSo, you operate locally, regionally and nationally.\n---\nBut internationally when you have to, when there\u2019s a gap?\n---\nYeah, when there are too many potatoes here, we have exported to Poland, exported to Ireland and Belgium quite a bit.\n---\nBut that\u2019s not a regular thing, that\u2019s just when the market requires it, if there\u2019s an opportunity we have to grab it.\n---\nHow would you consider yourself to be innovative?\n---\nWhat do you feel you are doing differently?\n---\nInitially we had to go through somewhere else other than [org name] and there is a lot of money in the middle man.\n---\nAnd basically, the idea was that we cut out the middle man and all that money comes back to the farm.\n---\nSo, we\u2019re not there to make money, we\u2019re there to pass the money back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that is the crux of the industry that has not been happening.\n---\nThe money going back to farmers \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s not been happening?\n---\nIt\u2019s not been going back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s what you aim to address?\n---\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to deal with.\n---\nAnd since we\u2019ve become in the area, doing what we\u2019re doing, these other mergers in the middle are taking the mass market out because they have to compete.\n---\nSo, are you saying there\u2019s now competition?\n---\nThere\u2019s more competition in the area.\n---\nSo, people have seen that it\u2019s a good idea and they want in on it?\n---\nYes, as it were.\n---\nI\u2019ve just obeyed the company really.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got a lot to do, to get to where we want to get to.\n---\nIt\u2019s certainly helping.\n---\nObviously, after Covid it\u2019s been a challenging year.\nIndeed.\n---\nSo, in terms of collaborators \u2013 well you\u2019ve touched on competition, but considering who you\u2019re collaborating with at the moment, there\u2019s the three farms and other suppliers?\n---\nThere\u2019s three farms that are direct suppliers, and then we have contractual other farms, basically guaranteeing us their spuds, contracted into the group.\n---\nAnd we supply factories like Walkers, McCains, Seabrooks \u2013 various crisps, all those sorts of people.\n---\n[unclear] Food, we do a little bit of pre-packaged for supermarkets with Morrison\u2019s and different people.\n---\n[unclear 0:08:51.0]\nAnd you\u2019ve explained that your role in this network is bypassing the middle man and making sure that the most profit goes from the customers back to the farmers?\n---\nYes, basically.\n---\nWho amongst the people you\u2019re working with, who are crucial?\n---\nWith the other people who you\u2019ve mentioned, who you\u2019re collaborating with, are they all crucial to the functioning of [org name] ?\n---\nNo, not the day-to-day running of it.\n---\nI\u2019m obviously managing the office with staff.\n---\nThey are obviously directors of the business, interested in how it works, but the day-to-day management comes back to me and the staff.\n---\nIs that what you mean?\n---\nYes, so what you\u2019re saying is that if a supplier dropped out, you could find a different supplier, and things like that?\n---\nYes, obviously the crucial thing is suppliers and farmers.\n---\nIf you haven\u2019t got them, or enough of them to supply the demand you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nSo, they\u2019re the important ones?\n---\nYes.\n---\nPlus, of course, the people who like yourself, are actually running the organisation, running the outfit?\n---\nWho\u2019s crucial within who runs it?\n---\nI think you just mentioned the people who are managing it?\n---\nYeah, that\u2019s me, we\u2019re the crucial ones.\n---\nWell, if we don\u2019t do what we do then someone else will do it.\n---\nBut yeah, we are the ones making it work.\n---\nSo, I think, looking a little bit towards the future, if you consider the next few years, and for the longer term, perhaps the next fifteen years, what would you say is your vision for what you might call, \u2018Future Food Systems\u2019?\n---\nMy vision for the future \u2013 I think sustainability is the key to anything.\n---\nIf we don\u2019t have sustainability, we\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nI want to bring more farmers on board, to grow our members; to see the benefits of what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nAnd also, to look at taking this \u2013 we\u2019ve just started off a 7.5kg bag line, it\u2019s a new thing for us, getting closer to the customer, and I think we\u2019ll look at something else to get closer to the customer really and cut the factories out, where we become further down the chain.\n---\nThe closer to the customer we get, the more we\u2019ll get back to the farm.\n---\nSo, ultimately

you\u2019ve already taken the next step towards doing that by starting a direct-to-customer service?\n---\nYeah, that was done \u2013 we launched about four months\u2019 ago.\n---\nAnd this is basically the direction you\u2019re going in, to expand that part of the business?\n---\nIt\u2019s part of it yes.\n---\nObviously, there are different areas.\n---\nWe want more growers on board, more

but meanwhile bring some cheap stuff in the backdoor.\n---\nAnd that, as an industry, as a country, for food manufacturing areas we need to clamp down on.\n---\nI\u2019m wondering if Brexit is a factor?\n---\nIf it\u2019s harder to import things, would that be in your favour?\n---\nWell, it\u2019s harder to import things, definitely.\n---\nBut as a country we haven\u2019t got enough manufacturers to process the potatoes we have in the country anyway.\n---\nSo, we\u2019ve let it all go abroad, potatoes go to Belgium and then come back ready-made.\n---\nBut that might be more difficult.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s about developing manufacturing capacity to actually use what we already have?\n---\nWe use what here, we import a large amount of potatoes anyway, for ready-made meals and things like that.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the product to use, it\u2019s here in the country but we\u2019re not utilising it.\n---\nAnd the factories, the money has been invested in other countries, not the UK for processing potatoes.\n---\nAnd I know there\u2019s McCain\u2019s have reduced what they spend here, and [unclear \u2013 0:16:17:0] their major competitor take potatoes out of the UK,

yeah.\n---\nIt\u2019s a long way to go to get through this.\n---\nFarming is in a dire mess.\n---\nAnd that includes potatoes.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s not necessarily for the price, it\u2019s the

I\u2019ve a \u00a32 million turnover business farming.\n---\nAnd it\u2019s not paying.\n---\nAnd I\u2019m on the [org name] , the middle part of that is paying, but without farmers, you haven\u2019t got a business.\n---\nSo, this is basically the main risk, the whole farming industry in the UK after Brexit?\n---\nWe don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s going to go.\n---\nThere are very few farms in the last two or even three years that are actually profitable to a level that is satisfactory to a bank manager.\n---\nThat is worrying indeed.\n---\nAnd the banks are \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult for them to lend, if the business has a negative cash flow, through no fault of their own.\n---\nAnd there\u2019ll be a lot of businesses after COVID with the same scenario now.\n---\nWe\u2019ll come back to COVID in a moment, but in your answer to business and in [org name] , what sort of contingency plans to you have for the next few years, to deal with these risks?\n---\nThe contingency plan for the farm side of things is basically reduce what I\u2019m doing, because I cannot risk the losses.\n---\nSo, I\u2019m actually downscaling what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nReducing the farm size.\n---\nNow I\u2019m in my late 30\u2019s (nearly 40!), I should really be pushing things on.\n---\nYeah, building things up, developing them, yeah.\n---\nDeveloping, and actually, we doing quite the opposite.\n---\nI\u2019m doing the less.\n---\nFrom the [org name]  point of view, basically, I\u2019m getting more growers on board and spreading the risk out to more growers.\n---\nSo, the more growers we get, the less at risk we are.\n---\nSo, can reduce risk on the [org name]  side by diversifying, bringing in more growers, and on the farm side all you can do is down scale to a point at which you feel you can operate?\nWhich is downscale to a point at which it\u2019s manageable and we can guarantee sales through all of our products we produce.\n---\nWhat else can you do?\n---\nI\u2019m going to be here in the future.\n---\nYes, you\u2019re just not quite sure how.\n---\nThat\u2019s all rather worrying.",
                    "contextualized_content": "The factories, the customers \u2013 to be honest, the customers are quite happy paying a fair price for a good quality product. However, the problem lies in market prices, where dealers in the middle and factories often drop the price for farmers when they can. This creates a need to move closer to the end product to sustain a steady, average price for sustainability. In the last two years, the base price has collapsed to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne, while farmers need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs and break even. The organization aims to charge a fair price to the end customer while ensuring enough profit to stay in business, which is crucial for their sustainability efforts. \n\nTo achieve this, they recognize the necessity of cutting out the \"rogues\" in the industry and have already taken steps towards this by launching a direct-to-customer service about four months ago. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to expand their business, attract more growers and customers, and streamline operations to drive out inefficiencies. The speaker notes that societal trends, particularly post-COVID, indicate a growing consumer interest in knowing the origins of their food, which could further support their vision. However, they also acknowledge the challenges posed by Brexit, particularly regarding the lack of processing capacity in the UK, which has led to a reliance on importing processed products. \n\nThe organization is aware of the financial constraints within the agricultural sector, as the banking industry has been hesitant to invest due to low profit margins. They emphasize the need for investment to develop processing capacity and ensure that farmers can effectively utilize their produce. The speaker expresses concern about the overall stability of agriculture in the UK, especially in light of recent challenges, and highlights the importance of diversifying their grower base to mitigate risks."

products we produce.\n---\nWhat else can you do?\n---\nI\u2019m going to be here in the future.\n---\nYes, you\u2019re just not quite sure how.\n---\nThat\u2019s all rather worrying.",
                    "contextualized_content": "The factories, the customers \u2013 to be honest, the customers are quite happy paying a fair price for a good quality product. However, the problem lies in market prices, where dealers in the middle and factories often drop the price for farmers when they can. This creates a need to move closer to the end product to sustain a steady, average price for sustainability. In the last two years, the base price has collapsed to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne, while farmers need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs and break even. The organization aims to charge a fair price to the end customer while ensuring enough profit to stay in business, which is crucial for their sustainability efforts. \n\nTo achieve this, they recognize the necessity of cutting out the \"rogues\" in the industry and have already taken steps towards this by launching a direct-to-customer service about four months ago. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to expand their business, attract more growers and customers, and streamline operations to drive out inefficiencies. The speaker notes that societal trends, particularly post-COVID, indicate a growing consumer interest in knowing the origins of their food, which could further support their vision. However, they also acknowledge the challenges posed by Brexit, particularly regarding the lack of processing capacity in the UK, which has led to a reliance on importing processed products. \n\nThe organization is aware of the financial constraints within the agricultural sector, as the banking industry has been hesitant to invest due to low profit margins. They emphasize the need for investment to develop processing capacity and ensure that farmers can effectively utilize their produce. The speaker expresses concern about the overall stability of agriculture in the UK, especially in light of recent challenges, and highlights the importance of diversifying their grower base to mitigate risks."

organisation?\n---\n[org name] , as an organisation, we had contracts \u2013 our customers basically tore up in front of us.\n---\nFor supply, we\u2019ve basically not been able to move the tonnage required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped.\n---\nAnd I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector.\n---\nSo, all of a sudden, we had a lot of potatoes sat there with no homes.\n---\nThat was a major effect.\n---\nTo the point after the lockdown now, this sector doesn\u2019t require the potatoes.\n---\nAnd we\u2019re planning now for 2021/2022 harvest and to be quite honest we\u2019ve got customers who won\u2019t sign a contract with us until they know more about what is going to happen.\n---\nBut as a farmer, you have to buy the seed, you have to plant the potatoes, you can\u2019t stop.\n---\nBut the customers are just saying, \u2018Well, not sure.\n---\nPlant them \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know later in the year whether we\u2019re going to take them or not.\u2019\n---\nAre you fearing you might end up with a pile of potatoes you can\u2019t sell to anybody?\nAbsolutely.\n---\nThousands of tonnes of potatoes in the ground and in sheds which will not get processed or used.\n---\nThey\u2019ll just get wasted.\n---\nI wonder if the Direct to Customer service could help here?\n---\nIf you could get some straight to the customers, would that help?\n---\nThere is an element of that, but there are a lot of people who don\u2019t use potatoes \u2013 the cooking at home is rice, it\u2019s pasta.\n---\nCertainly, don\u2019t want to be importing stuff, which is what\u2019s coming up.\n---\nSo, if you want to help the British farmers, the supermarkets, the factories need to stop importing stuff.\n---\nAnd start taking things from British suppliers.\n---\nSo, is [org name]  a suitable venue to publicise this, to actually say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got all this stuff, you don\u2019t need to go abroad\u2019?\n---\nWell, it is, but we\u2019re probably not a big enough player.\n---\nWhen you\u2019re talking to the likes of McCain\u2019s, and Walkers, and those sorts of people, they\u2019re a multinational company anyway, they have suppliers from all over the place.\n---\nIt\u2019s got to come from government level really, to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019\n---\nOr the supermarkets, the customers.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not the public, it is the supermarkets.\n---\nAnd the government has got to say, \u2018No, enough is enough.\u2019\n---\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID?\n---\nAnything at all?\n---\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes \u2013 that side of things has done very well on the back of it.\n---\nSo, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s good.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not to the same scale as what we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\n---\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re not going to go quite back to the way you were before?\n---\nIt\u2019s going to be different?\n---\nIt\u2019ll certainly be different.\n---\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\n---\nYeah, it\u2019s killing agriculture big style.\n---\nIf all the manufacturers stop, it\u2019ll kill it.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s all very worrying.\n---\nWell, I hope things get better for you.\n---\nI\u2019ve come to the end of my questions now, you\u2019ve shed a lot of insight into what\u2019s sort of happening in this situation.\n---\nI wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\n---\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\n---\nWe\u2019ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that.\n---\nFind out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI think there are two-three solutions to the problem.\n---\nOne, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to.\n---\nI think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back.\n---\nAnd these food miles are absolutely nuts.\n---\nIt\u2019s mad.\n---\nAnd yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nWe\u2019ll have no business left.\n---\nThe banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\n---\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really!\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down.\n---\nBut I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves.\n---\nWe need to be able survive\n---\nand we need to be competitive.\n---\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\n---\nYes.\n---\nAnd the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot.\n---\nPut it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\n---\nThat seems very clear.\n---\nAs we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\n---\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\n---\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s more money coming back to the farm.\n---\nEND",
                    "contextualized_content": "The COVID crisis has had a profound impact on [org name] and the agricultural sector as a whole. With contracts being abruptly canceled, the organization faced a significant challenge in moving the required tonnage of potatoes, particularly as one-third of the potato industry supplies the food sector, which includes restaurants that suddenly ceased operations. This left a surplus of potatoes with no market, leading to concerns about waste and financial losses. As they plan for the upcoming harvest, uncertainty looms as customers hesitate to commit to contracts, creating a precarious situation for farmers who must continue planting without guaranteed sales. \n\nDespite these challenges, there have been some positive developments, such as the growth of small outlets and online sales, which have gained traction during the pandemic. However, the overall landscape remains daunting, with the combination of COVID and Brexit posing significant threats to the agricultural industry. The speaker emphasizes the need for local sourcing and investment to create a more resilient food system, advocating for a reduction in food miles and a more efficient distribution of resources to support farmers and ensure sustainability."

you\u2019ve already taken the next step towards doing that by starting a direct-to-customer service?\n---\nYeah, that was done \u2013 we launched about four months\u2019 ago.\n---\nAnd this is basically the direction you\u2019re going in, to expand that part of the business?\n---\nIt\u2019s part of it yes.\n---\nObviously, there are different areas.\n---\nWe want more growers on board, more customers, and to grow that base we\u2019d need to add more of what we\u2019re doing and probably streamline what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s a three-way approach where we can drive out the inefficiencies, really.\n---\nAnd another thing, well as you know, things have changed quite recently \u2013 can you see any trends in society that could perhaps accelerate the vision that you\u2019ve just put forward, that might contribute to help?\n---\nObviously, COVID is a massive thing.\n---\nI do think there is more of an element of people wanting to know where it\u2019s come from.\n---\nAnd I think there is an element of people wanting that, but it\u2019s how you get the price and the customers to stop undermining everything we\u2019re doing in the UK, in the food industry.\n---\nBecause customers are willing to pay for it.\n---\nThey\u2019re willing to pay for quality.\n---\nBut, there\u2019s people within the system that will say, \u2018This is this,\u2019 but meanwhile bring some cheap stuff in the backdoor.\n---\nAnd that, as an industry, as a country, for food manufacturing areas we need to clamp down on.\n---\nI\u2019m wondering if Brexit is a factor?\n---\nIf it\u2019s harder to import things, would that be in your favour?\n---\nWell, it\u2019s harder to import things, definitely.\n---\nBut as a country we haven\u2019t got enough manufacturers to process the potatoes we have in the country anyway.\n---\nSo, we\u2019ve let it all go abroad, potatoes go to Belgium and then come back ready-made.\n---\nBut that might be more difficult.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s about developing manufacturing capacity to actually use what we already have?\n---\nWe use what here, we import a large amount of potatoes anyway, for ready-made meals and things like that.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the product to use, it\u2019s here in the country but we\u2019re not utilising it.\n---\nAnd the factories, the money has been invested in other countries, not the UK for processing potatoes.\n---\nAnd I know there\u2019s McCain\u2019s have reduced what they spend here, and [unclear \u2013 0:16:17:0] their major competitor take potatoes out of the UK, into Belgium, process them and they come back as a value pack for the supermarkets.\n---\nWhy are we allowing the road miles and everything else \u2013 it\u2019s crackers.\n---\nSo, it sounds like the bottle-neck is actually going to be processing capacity in the UK?\n---\nYes.\n---\nThe farmers are there, they\u2019ll do a good job.\n---\nThey\u2019re there to do it.\n---\nBut if they can\u2019t process what we produce, we\u2019re snookered.\n---\nWe\u2019re just flooding the market.\n---\nDo you think that [org name]  could actually, in any way, contribute towards helping with developing this processing capacity?\n---\nWe could, but the trouble with all these ideas is that they cost a lot of money.\n---\nAnd at a farm level, there isn\u2019t a lot of money left in the tank to be able to chuck at these things.\n---\nYou\u2019ve got to make your profits to then reinvest them.\n---\nAnd the banking industry is backing away from agriculture, because it\u2019s not seen as a very well \u2013 the profit margins are pathetic.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s building that to go forward.\n---\nMoney is key.\n---\nJust like a chicken and egg scenario, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nYes.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re aware of this issue but you might not be in a position personally to do much about it?\nExactly.\n---\nI can see the issue.\n---\nI know exactly what the issue is\n---\nand I know where you\u2019d take it forward.\n---\nBut without the investment or money to back what requires doing, it\u2019s a waste of time, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nSo, moving on a little bit more to financial issues, how resilient do you feel your organisation is?\n---\nHow stable do you think things might be, going forward in the next few years?\n---\nThe stability in [org name]  is fine.\n---\nThe stability in agriculture and farming is disastrous.\n---\nWithout the farmers and the potatoes, and supply what ever you\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not very stable.\n---\nThe problem is, manufacturing full stop.\n---\nIn this country I\u2019m hoping Brexit will change it but we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve got a good deal or a bad deal yet, do we?\n---\nIt\u2019s still evolving, yeah.\n---\nIt\u2019s a long way to go to get through this.\n---\nFarming is in a dire mess.\n---\nAnd that includes potatoes.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s not necessarily for the price, it\u2019s the weather patterns and everything.\n---\nIt\u2019s very, very difficult.\n---\nI\u2019m looking at things from two sides of the fence.\n---\nAnd so, which two sides?\n---\nThe side of the farmer, I\u2019ve a \u00a32 million turnover business farming.\n---\nAnd it\u2019s not paying.\n---\nAnd I\u2019m on the [org name] , the middle part of that is paying, but without farmers, you haven\u2019t got a business.\n---\nSo, this is basically the main risk, the whole farming industry in the UK after Brexit?\n---\nWe don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s going to go.\n---\nThere are very few farms in the last two or even three years that are actually profitable to a level that is satisfactory to a bank manager.\n---\nThat is worrying indeed.\n---\nAnd the banks are \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult for them to lend, if the business has a negative cash flow, through no fault of their own.\n---\nAnd there\u2019ll be a lot of businesses after COVID with the same scenario now.\n---\nWe\u2019ll come back to COVID in a moment, but in your answer to business and in [org name] , what sort of contingency plans to you have for the next few years, to deal with these risks?\n---\nThe contingency plan for the farm side of things is basically reduce what I\u2019m doing, because I cannot risk the losses.\n---\nSo, I\u2019m actually downscaling what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nReducing the farm size.\n---\nNow I\u2019m in my late 30\u2019s (nearly 40!), I should really be pushing things on.\n---\nYeah, building things up, developing them, yeah.\n---\nDeveloping, and actually, we doing quite the opposite.\n---\nI\u2019m doing the less.\n---\nFrom the [org name]  point of view, basically, I\u2019m getting more growers on board and spreading the risk out to more growers.\n---\nSo, the more growers we get, the less at risk we are.\n---\nSo, can reduce risk on the [org name]  side by diversifying, bringing in more growers, and on the farm side all you can do is down scale to a point at which you feel you can operate?\nWhich is downscale to a point at which it\u2019s manageable and we can guarantee sales through all of our products we produce.\n---\nWhat else can you do?\n---\nI\u2019m going to be here in the future.\n---\nYes, you\u2019re just not quite sure how.\n---\nThat\u2019s all rather worrying.",
                    "contextualized_content": "The factories, the customers \u2013 to be honest, the customers are quite happy paying a fair price for a good quality product. However, the problem lies in market prices, where dealers in the middle and factories often drop the price for farmers when they can. This creates a need to move closer to the end product to sustain a steady, average price for sustainability. In the last two years, the base price has collapsed to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne, while farmers need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs and break even. The organization aims to charge a fair price to the end customer while ensuring enough profit to stay in business, which is crucial for their sustainability efforts. \n\nTo achieve this, they recognize the necessity of cutting out the \"rogues\" in the industry and have already taken steps towards this by launching a direct-to-customer service about four months ago. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to expand their business, attract more growers and customers, and streamline operations to drive out inefficiencies. The speaker notes that societal trends, particularly post-COVID, indicate a growing consumer interest in knowing the origins of their food, which could further support their vision. However, they also acknowledge the challenges posed by Brexit, particularly regarding the lack of processing capacity in the UK, which has led to a reliance on importing processed products. \n\nThe organization is aware of the financial constraints within the agricultural sector, as the banking industry has been hesitant to invest due to low profit margins. They emphasize the need for investment to develop processing capacity and ensure that farmers can effectively utilize their produce. The speaker expresses concern about the overall stability of agriculture in the UK, especially in light of recent challenges, and highlights the importance of diversifying their grower base to mitigate risks."

                    "original_content": "Could you say a little bit about your organisation\u2019s activities?\n---\nWhen you say that, do you mean the farm side or the [org name] ?\n---\nI think the [org name].\n---\n[org name] is 3 farmers, we all grow potatoes.\n---\nWe are all selling individually, and what we\u2019re trying to do is come together to make an organisation basically, where all our potatoes are bought centrally and marketed all together.\n---\nSo, fundamentally, we brought in a trader to take the burden out of the individual farms and get closer to the customers, because the customers don\u2019t really want to deal with the farms, they would rather go through an organisation.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s like an interface between the farmers and the customers?\n---\nYes, basically, somewhere in the middle it\u2019s owned by the farmers.\n---\nSet up for the farmers.\n---\nAnd the idea is by taking the middle man out, we are the middle man.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re taking the middle man out from between the farmers and the market?\n---\nYes.\n---\nWe are the traders in the middle.\n---\nThat\u2019s great.\n---\nWhat\u2019s your personal involvement in this?\n---\nWhat role do you play?\n---\nWhen the factory wants loads, well, rather than going to individual farms, we manage their supply into the factory.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s about ten-fifteen farms, supplying in.\n---\nAnd we manage that supply so that there\u2019s a steady supply of potatoes rather than odds and sods here and there.\n---\nThen obviously, they pay [org name]  and [org name]  distributes the money out to the farmers.\n---\nSo, I believe you operate on a local level?\n---\nThe main core of the group is local.\n---\nBut then we do supply factories all over the country.\n---\nAnd we buy potatoes from all over the country as well, on an ad hoc basis, so we can supply all year round because potatoes arrive at different periods of the year.\n---\nAnd obviously, we want to supply the factories all year round, and they want a supply all year round.\n---\nSo, we buy from other farms as well, which supply at different times of year, it varies.\n---\nIs this nationally, or do you do anything with factories or suppliers in other countries?\n---\nWe do a little bit.\n---\nWe have exported in the past.\n---\nNot much this year.\n---\nLast year we were exporting and importing.\n---\nBut it\u2019s only really to fill any gaps.\n---\nWhen we have extreme heat, or anything like that, we just fill in gaps when there\u2019s surplus, things like that.\n---\nSo, you operate locally, regionally and nationally.\n---\nBut internationally when you have to, when there\u2019s a gap?\n---\nYeah, when there are too many potatoes here, we have exported to Poland, exported to Ireland and Belgium quite a bit.\n---\nBut that\u2019s not a regular thing, that\u2019s just when the market requires it, if there\u2019s an opportunity we have to grab it.\n---\nHow would you consider yourself to be innovative?\n---\nWhat do you feel you are doing differently?\n---\nInitially we had to go through somewhere else other than [org name] and there is a lot of money in the middle man.\n---\nAnd basically, the idea was that we cut out the middle man and all that money comes back to the farm.\n---\nSo, we\u2019re not there to make money, we\u2019re there to pass the money back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that is the crux of the industry that has not been happening.\n---\nThe money going back to farmers \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s not been happening?\n---\nIt\u2019s not been going back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s what you aim to address?\n---\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to deal with.\n---\nAnd since we\u2019ve become in the area, doing what we\u2019re doing, these other mergers in the middle are taking the mass market out because they have to compete.\n---\nSo, are you saying there\u2019s now competition?\n---\nThere\u2019s more competition in the area.\n---\nSo, people have seen that it\u2019s a good idea and they want in on it?\n---\nYes, as it were.\n---\nI\u2019ve just obeyed the company really.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got a lot to do, to get to where we want to get to.\n---\nIt\u2019s certainly helping.\n---\nObviously, after Covid it\u2019s been a challenging year.\nIndeed.\n---\nSo, in terms of collaborators \u2013 well you\u2019ve touched on competition, but considering who you\u2019re collaborating with at the moment, there\u2019s the three farms and other suppliers?\n---\nThere\u2019s three farms that are direct suppliers, and then we have contractual other farms, basically guaranteeing us their spuds, contracted into the group.\n---\nAnd we supply factories like Walkers, McCains, Seabrooks \u2013 various crisps, all those sorts of people.\n---\n[unclear] Food, we do a little bit of pre-packaged for supermarkets with Morrison\u2019s and different people.\n---\n[unclear 0:08:51.0]\nAnd you\u2019ve explained that your role in this network is bypassing the middle man and making sure that the most profit goes from the customers back to the farmers?\n---\nYes, basically.\n---\nWho amongst the people you\u2019re working with, who are crucial?\n---\nWith the other people who you\u2019ve mentioned, who you\u2019re collaborating with, are they all crucial to the functioning of [org name] ?\n---\nNo, not the day-to-day running of it.\n---\nI\u2019m obviously managing the office with staff.\n---\nThey are obviously directors of the business, interested in how it works, but the day-to-day management comes back to me and the staff.\n---\nIs that what you mean?\n---\nYes, so what you\u2019re saying is that if a supplier dropped out, you could find a different supplier, and things like that?\n---\nYes, obviously the crucial thing is suppliers and farmers.\n---\nIf you haven\u2019t got them, or enough of them to supply the demand you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nSo, they\u2019re the important ones?\n---\nYes.\n---\nPlus, of course, the people who like yourself, are actually running the organisation, running the outfit?\n---\nWho\u2019s crucial within who runs it?\n---\nI think you just mentioned the people who are managing it?\n---\nYeah, that\u2019s me, we\u2019re the crucial ones.\n---\nWell, if we don\u2019t do what we do then someone else will do it.\n---\nBut yeah, we are the ones making it work.\n---\nSo, I think, looking a little bit towards the future, if you consider the next few years, and for the longer term, perhaps the next fifteen years, what would you say is your vision for what you might call, \u2018Future Food Systems\u2019?\n---\nMy vision for the future \u2013 I think sustainability is the key to anything.\n---\nIf we don\u2019t have sustainability, we\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nI want to bring more farmers on board, to grow our members; to see the benefits of what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nAnd also, to look at taking this \u2013 we\u2019ve just started off a 7.5kg bag line, it\u2019s a new thing for us, getting closer to the customer, and I think we\u2019ll look at something else to get closer to the customer really and cut the factories out, where we become further down the chain.\n---\nThe closer to the customer we get, the more we\u2019ll get back to the farm.\n---\nSo, ultimately you would have a process that would take the produce directly from the farm, straight to the end customer?\n---\nThat is the ultimate.\n---\nI think rather than just selling the potato, we\u2019ll slice it, and things like that.\n---\nOr we\u2019ll put it into ready-made meals.\n---\nWell maybe not that, but get it ready to go closer to the end user.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re sort of gradually, as you mentioned, bypassing elements of the chain, starting recently with going direct to consumer and that\u2019s the direction you want to take in the future?\n---\nI think one thing is the scale, we need to increase the volumes we trade as a group.\n---\nAnd on the other side we need an avenue where we get closer to the customer, to take the volatility out of the job.\n---\nAnd how do you feel this will contribute to sustainability?\nBecause you\u2019ve got [unclear] contracts in front of you.",
                    "contextualized_content": "The organization, referred to as [org name], consists of three farmers who specialize in potato cultivation. They are working collaboratively to centralize the purchasing and marketing of their potatoes, which allows them to streamline operations and reduce reliance on traditional middlemen. By bringing in a trader, they aim to alleviate the burden on individual farms and connect more directly with customers, who prefer dealing with an organization rather than multiple individual farms. This setup not only enhances efficiency but also ensures that profits are returned to the farmers, addressing a significant issue in the agricultural sector where farmers often see little of the profits generated from their produce. The organization operates primarily on a local level but also engages in regional and national supply, and occasionally exports to fill market gaps. Their innovative approach focuses on sustainability and direct sales to consumers, which they believe will further enhance their profitability and stability in the long term."

organisation?\n---\n[org name] , as an organisation, we had contracts \u2013 our customers basically tore up in front of us.\n---\nFor supply, we\u2019ve basically not been able to move the tonnage required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped.\n---\nAnd I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector.\n---\nSo, all of a sudden, we had a lot of potatoes sat there with no homes.\n---\nThat was a major effect.\n---\nTo the point after the lockdown now, this sector doesn\u2019t require the potatoes.\n---\nAnd we\u2019re planning now for 2021/2022 harvest and to be quite honest we\u2019ve got customers who won\u2019t sign a contract with us until they know more about what is going to happen.\n---\nBut as a farmer, you have to buy the seed, you have to plant the potatoes, you can\u2019t stop.\n---\nBut the customers are just saying, \u2018Well, not sure.\n---\nPlant them \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know

tonnes of potatoes in the ground and in sheds which will not get processed or used.\n---\nThey\u2019ll just get wasted.\n---\nI wonder if the Direct to Customer service could help here?\n---\nIf you could get some straight to the customers, would that help?\n---\nThere is an element of that, but there are a lot of people who don\u2019t use potatoes \u2013 the cooking at home is rice, it\u2019s pasta.\n---\nCertainly, don\u2019t want to be importing stuff, which is what\u2019s coming up.\n---\nSo, if you want to help the British farmers, the supermarkets, the factories need to stop importing stuff.\n---\nAnd start taking things from British suppliers.\n---\nSo, is [org name]  a suitable venue to publicise this, to actually say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got all this stuff, you don\u2019t need to go abroad\u2019?\n---\nWell, it is, but we\u2019re probably not a big enough player.\n---\nWhen you\u2019re talking to the likes of McCain\u2019s, and Walkers, and those sorts of people, they\u2019re a multinational company anyway, they have suppliers from all over the place.\n---\nIt\u2019s got to come from government level really, to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019\n---\nOr the supermarkets, the customers.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not the public, it is the supermarkets.\n---\nAnd the government has got to say, \u2018No, enough is enough.\u2019\n---\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID?\n---\nAnything at all?\n---\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes \u2013 that side of things has done very well on the back of it.\n---\nSo, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s good.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not to the same scale as what we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\n---\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re not going to go quite back to the way you were before?\n---\nIt\u2019s going to be different?\n---\nIt\u2019ll certainly be different.\n---\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\n---\nYeah, it\u2019s killing agriculture big style.\n---\nIf all the manufacturers stop, it\u2019ll kill it.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s all very worrying.\n---\nWell, I hope things get better for you.\n---\nI\u2019ve come to the end of my questions now, you\u2019ve shed a lot of insight into what\u2019s sort of happening in this situation.\n---\nI wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\n---\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\n---\nWe\u2019ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that.\n---\nFind out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI think there are two-three solutions to the problem.\n---\nOne, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to.\n---\nI think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back.\n---\nAnd these food miles are absolutely nuts.\n---\nIt\u2019s mad.\n---\nAnd yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nWe\u2019ll have no business left.\n---\nThe banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\n---\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really!\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down.\n---\nBut I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves.\n---\nWe need to be able survive\n---\nand we need to be competitive.\n---\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\n---\nYes.\n---\nAnd the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot.\n---\nPut it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\n---\nThat seems very clear.\n---\nAs we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\n---\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\n---\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s more money coming back to the farm.\n---\nEND",
                    "contextualized_content": "The COVID crisis has had a profound impact on [org name] and the agricultural sector as a whole. With contracts being abruptly canceled, the organization faced a significant challenge in moving the required tonnage of potatoes, particularly as one-third of the potato industry supplies the food sector, which includes restaurants that suddenly ceased operations. This left a surplus of potatoes with no market, leading to concerns about waste and financial losses. As they plan for the upcoming harvest, uncertainty looms as customers hesitate to commit to contracts, creating a precarious situation for farmers who must continue planting without guaranteed sales. \n\nDespite these challenges, there have been some positive developments, such as the growth of small outlets and online sales, which have gained traction during the pandemic. However, the overall landscape remains daunting, with the combination of COVID and Brexit posing significant threats to the agricultural industry. The speaker emphasizes the need for local sourcing and investment to create a more resilient food system, advocating for a reduction in food miles and a more efficient distribution of resources to support farmers and ensure sustainability."

                    "original_content": "Could you say a little bit about your organisation\u2019s activities?\n---\nWhen you say that, do you mean the farm side or the [org name] ?\n---\nI think the [org name].\n---\n[org name] is 3 farmers, we all grow potatoes.\n---\nWe are all selling individually, and what we\u2019re trying to do is come together to make an organisation basically, where all our potatoes are bought centrally and marketed all together.\n---\nSo, fundamentally, we brought in a trader to take the burden out of the individual farms and get closer to the customers, because the customers don\u2019t really want to deal with the farms, they would rather go through an organisation.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s like an interface between the farmers and the customers?\n---\nYes, basically, somewhere in the middle it\u2019s owned by the farmers.\n---\nSet up for the farmers.\n---\nAnd the idea is by taking the middle man out, we are the middle man.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re taking the middle man out from between the farmers and the market?\n---\nYes.\n---\nWe are the traders in the middle.\n---\nThat\u2019s great.\n---\nWhat\u2019s your personal involvement in this?\n---\nWhat role do you play?\n---\nWhen the factory wants loads, well, rather than going to individual farms, we manage their supply into the factory.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s about ten-fifteen farms, supplying in.\n---\nAnd we manage that supply so that there\u2019s a steady supply of potatoes rather than odds and sods here and there.\n---\nThen obviously, they pay [org name]  and [org name]  distributes the money out to the farmers.\n---\nSo, I believe you operate on a local level?\n---\nThe main core of the group is local.\n---\nBut then we do supply factories all over the country.\n---\nAnd we buy potatoes from all over the country as well, on an ad hoc basis, so we can supply all year round because potatoes arrive at different periods of the year.\n---\nAnd obviously, we want to supply the factories all year round, and they want a supply all year round.\n---\nSo, we buy from other farms as well, which supply at different times of year, it varies.\n---\nIs this nationally, or do you do anything with factories or suppliers in other countries?\n---\nWe do a little bit.\n---\nWe have exported in the past.\n---\nNot much this year.\n---\nLast year we were exporting and importing.\n---\nBut it\u2019s only really to fill any gaps.\n---\nWhen we have extreme heat, or anything like that, we just fill in gaps when there\u2019s surplus, things like that.\n---\nSo, you operate locally, regionally and nationally.\n---\nBut internationally when you have to, when there\u2019s a gap?\n---\nYeah, when there are too many potatoes here, we have exported to Poland, exported to Ireland and Belgium quite a bit.\n---\nBut that\u2019s not a regular thing, that\u2019s just when the market requires it, if there\u2019s an opportunity we have to grab it.\n---\nHow would you consider yourself to be innovative?\n---\nWhat do you feel you are doing differently?\n---\nInitially we had to go through somewhere else other than [org name] and there is a lot of money in the middle man.\n---\nAnd basically, the idea was that we cut out the middle man and all that money comes back to the farm.\n---\nSo, we\u2019re not there to make money, we\u2019re there to pass the money back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that is the crux of the industry that has not been happening.\n---\nThe money going back to farmers \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s not been happening?\n---\nIt\u2019s not been going back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s what you aim to address?\n---\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to deal with.\n---\nAnd since we\u2019ve become in the area, doing what we\u2019re doing, these other mergers in the middle are taking the mass market out because they have to compete.\n---\nSo, are you saying there\u2019s now competition?\n---\nThere\u2019s more competition in the area.\n---\nSo, people have seen that it\u2019s a good idea and they want in on it?\n---\nYes, as it were.\n---\nI\u2019ve just obeyed the company really.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got a lot to do, to get to where we want to get to.\n---\nIt\u2019s certainly helping.\n---\nObviously, after Covid it\u2019s been a challenging year.\nIndeed.\n---\nSo, in terms of collaborators \u2013 well you\u2019ve touched on competition, but considering who you\u2019re collaborating with at the moment, there\u2019s the three farms and other suppliers?\n---\nThere\u2019s three farms that are direct suppliers, and then we have contractual other farms, basically guaranteeing us their spuds, contracted into the group.\n---\nAnd we supply factories like Walkers, McCains, Seabrooks \u2013 various crisps, all those sorts of people.\n---\n[unclear] Food, we do a little bit of pre-packaged for supermarkets with Morrison\u2019s and different people.\n---\n[unclear 0:08:51.0]\nAnd you\u2019ve explained that your role in this network is bypassing the middle man and making sure that the most profit goes from the customers back to the farmers?\n---\nYes, basically.\n---\nWho amongst the people you\u2019re working with, who are crucial?\n---\nWith the other people who you\u2019ve mentioned, who you\u2019re collaborating with, are they all crucial to the functioning of [org name] ?\n---\nNo, not the day-to-day running of it.\n---\nI\u2019m obviously managing the office with staff.\n---\nThey are obviously directors of the business, interested in how it works, but the day-to-day management comes back to me and the staff.\n---\nIs that what you mean?\n---\nYes, so what you\u2019re saying is that if a supplier dropped out, you could find a different supplier, and things like that?\n---\nYes, obviously the crucial thing is suppliers and farmers.\n---\nIf you haven\u2019t got them, or enough of them to supply the demand you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nSo, they\u2019re the important ones?\n---\nYes.\n---\nPlus, of course, the people who like yourself, are actually running the organisation, running the outfit?\n---\nWho\u2019s crucial within who runs it?\n---\nI think you just mentioned the people who are managing it?\n---\nYeah, that\u2019s me, we\u2019re the crucial ones.\n---\nWell, if we don\u2019t do what we do then someone else will do it.\n---\nBut yeah, we are the ones making it work.\n---\nSo, I think, looking a little bit towards the future, if you consider the next few years, and for the longer term, perhaps the next fifteen years, what would you say is your vision for what you might call, \u2018Future Food Systems\u2019?\n---\nMy vision for the future \u2013 I think sustainability is the key to anything.\n---\nIf we don\u2019t have sustainability, we\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nI want to bring more farmers on board, to grow our members; to see the benefits of what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nAnd also, to look at taking this \u2013 we\u2019ve just started off a 7.5kg bag line, it\u2019s a new thing for us, getting closer to the customer, and I think we\u2019ll look at something else to get closer to the customer really and cut the factories out, where we become further down the chain.\n---\nThe closer to the customer we get, the more we\u2019ll get back to the farm.\n---\nSo, ultimately you would have a process that would take the produce directly from the farm, straight to the end customer?\n---\nThat is the ultimate.\n---\nI think rather than just selling the potato, we\u2019ll slice it, and things like that.\n---\nOr we\u2019ll put it into ready-made meals.\n---\nWell maybe not that, but get it ready to go closer to the end user.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re sort of gradually, as you mentioned, bypassing elements of the chain, starting recently with going direct to consumer and that\u2019s the direction you want to take in the future?\n---\nI think one thing is the scale, we need to increase the volumes we trade as a group.\n---\nAnd on the other side we need an avenue where we get closer to the customer, to take the volatility out of the job.\n---\nAnd how do you feel this will contribute to sustainability?\nBecause you\u2019ve got [unclear] contracts in front of you.",
                    "contextualized_content": "The organization, referred to as [org name], consists of three farmers who specialize in potato cultivation. They are working collaboratively to centralize the purchasing and marketing of their potatoes, which allows them to streamline operations and reduce reliance on traditional middlemen. By bringing in a trader, they aim to alleviate the burden on individual farms and connect more directly with customers, who prefer dealing with an organization rather than multiple individual farms. This setup not only enhances efficiency but also ensures that profits are returned to the farmers, addressing a significant issue in the agricultural sector where farmers often see little of the profits generated from their produce. The organization operates primarily on a local level but also engages in regional and national supply, and occasionally exports to fill market gaps. Their innovative approach focuses on sustainability and direct sales to consumers, which they believe will further enhance their profitability and stability in the long term."

                    "original_content": "---\nThe factories, the customers \u2013 to be honest, the customers are quite happy paying a fair price for a good quality product.\n---\nThe problem is market prices \u2013 these dealers in the middle, and the factories, are really, when they can do, dropping the price for the farmers.\n---\nSo, we need to move closer to the end product where we can sustain a steady, average price for sustainability.\n---\nBecause in the last two years, we\u2019ve seen the base price collapse to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne.\n---\nAnd to give you an idea, we need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs, to break even.\n---\nAnd so, you can charge a fair price to the end customer whilst still getting enough profit to stay in business?\n---\nYes.\n---\nRight, good.\n---\nSo, we need to get close to then cut those rogues out the industry, really.\n---\nOkay, so it\u2019s cutting the rogues out.\n---\nSo, it sounds like you\u2019ve already taken the next step towards doing that by starting a direct-to-customer service?\n---\nYeah, that was done \u2013 we launched about four months\u2019 ago.\n---\nAnd this is basically the direction you\u2019re going in, to expand that part of the business?\n---\nIt\u2019s part of it yes.\n---\nObviously, there are different areas.\n---\nWe want more growers on board, more customers, and to grow that base we\u2019d need to add more of what we\u2019re doing and probably streamline what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s a three-way approach where we can drive out the inefficiencies, really.\n---\nAnd another thing, well as you know, things have changed quite recently \u2013 can you see any trends in society that could perhaps accelerate the vision that you\u2019ve just put forward, that might contribute to help?\n---\nObviously, COVID is a massive thing.\n---\nI do think there is more of an element of people wanting to know where it\u2019s come from.\n---\nAnd I think there is an element of people wanting that, but it\u2019s how you get the price and the customers to stop undermining everything we\u2019re doing in the UK, in the food industry.\n---\nBecause customers are willing to pay for it.\n---\nThey\u2019re willing to pay for quality.\n---\nBut, there\u2019s people within the system that will say, \u2018This is this,\u2019 but meanwhile bring some cheap stuff in the backdoor.\n---\nAnd that, as an industry, as a country, for food manufacturing areas we need to clamp down on.\n---\nI\u2019m wondering if Brexit is a factor?\n---\nIf it\u2019s harder to import things, would that be in your favour?\n---\nWell, it\u2019s harder to import things, definitely.\n---\nBut as a country we haven\u2019t got enough manufacturers to process the potatoes we have in the country anyway.\n---\nSo, we\u2019ve let it all go abroad, potatoes go to Belgium and then come back ready-made.\n---\nBut that might be more difficult.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s about developing manufacturing capacity to actually use what we already have?\n---\nWe use what here, we import a large amount of potatoes anyway, for ready-made meals and things like that.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the product to use, it\u2019s here in the country but we\u2019re not utilising it.\n---\nAnd the factories, the money has been invested in other countries, not the UK for processing potatoes.\n---\nAnd I know there\u2019s McCain\u2019s have reduced what they spend here, and [unclear \u2013 0:16:17:0] their major competitor take potatoes out of the UK, into Belgium, process them and they come back as a value pack for the supermarkets.\n---\nWhy are we allowing the road miles and everything else \u2013 it\u2019s crackers.\n---\nSo, it sounds like the bottle-neck is actually going to be processing capacity in the UK?\n---\nYes.\n---\nThe farmers are there, they\u2019ll do a good job.\n---\nThey\u2019re there to do it.\n---\nBut if they can\u2019t process what we produce, we\u2019re snookered.\n---\nWe\u2019re just flooding the market.\n---\nDo you think that [org name]  could actually, in any way, contribute towards helping with developing this processing capacity?\n---\nWe could, but the trouble with all these ideas is that they cost a lot of money.\n---\nAnd at a farm level, there isn\u2019t a lot of money left in the tank to be able to chuck at these things.\n---\nYou\u2019ve got to make your profits to then reinvest them.\n---\nAnd the banking industry is backing away from agriculture, because it\u2019s not seen as a very well \u2013 the profit margins are pathetic.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s building that to go forward.\n---\nMoney is key.\n---\nJust like a chicken and egg scenario, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nYes.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re aware of this issue but you might not be in a position personally to do much about it?\nExactly.\n---\nI can see the issue.\n---\nI know exactly what the issue is\n---\nand I know where you\u2019d take it forward.\n---\nBut without the investment or money to back what requires doing, it\u2019s a waste of time, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nSo, moving on a little bit more to financial issues, how resilient do you feel your organisation is?\n---\nHow stable do you think things might be, going forward in the next few years?\n---\nThe stability in [org name]  is fine.\n---\nThe stability in agriculture and farming is disastrous.\n---\nWithout the farmers and the potatoes, and supply what ever you\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not very stable.\n---\nThe problem is, manufacturing full stop.\n---\nIn this country I\u2019m hoping Brexit will change it but we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve got a good deal or a bad deal yet, do we?\n---\nIt\u2019s still evolving, yeah.\n---\nIt\u2019s a long way to go to get through this.\n---\nFarming is in a dire mess.\n---\nAnd that includes potatoes.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s not necessarily for the price, it\u2019s the weather patterns and everything.\n---\nIt\u2019s very, very difficult.\n---\nI\u2019m looking at things from two sides of the fence.\n---\nAnd so, which two sides?\n---\nThe side of the farmer, I\u2019ve a \u00a32 million turnover business farming.\n---\nAnd it\u2019s not paying.\n---\nAnd I\u2019m on the [org name] , the middle part of that is paying, but without farmers, you haven\u2019t got a business.\n---\nSo, this is basically the main risk, the whole farming industry in the UK after Brexit?\n---\nWe don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s going to go.\n---\nThere are very few farms in the last two or even three years that are actually profitable to a level that is satisfactory to a bank manager.\n---\nThat is worrying indeed.\n---\nAnd the banks are \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult for them to lend, if the business has a negative cash flow, through no fault of their own.\n---\nAnd there\u2019ll be a lot of businesses after COVID with the same scenario now.\n---\nWe\u2019ll come back to COVID in a moment, but in your answer to business and in [org name] , what sort of contingency plans to you have for the next few years, to deal with these risks?\n---\nThe contingency plan for the farm side of things is basically reduce what I\u2019m doing, because I cannot risk the losses.\n---\nSo, I\u2019m actually downscaling what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nReducing the farm size.\n---\nNow I\u2019m in my late 30\u2019s (nearly 40!), I should really be pushing things on.\n---\nYeah, building things up, developing them, yeah.\n---\nDeveloping, and actually, we doing quite the opposite.\n---\nI\u2019m doing the less.\n---\nFrom the [org name]  point of view, basically, I\u2019m getting more growers on board and spreading the risk out to more growers.\n---\nSo, the more growers we get, the less at risk we are.\n---\nSo, can reduce risk on the [org name]  side by diversifying, bringing in more growers, and on the farm side all you can do is down scale to a point at which you feel you can operate?\nWhich is downscale to a point at which it\u2019s manageable and we can guarantee sales through all of our products we produce.\n---\nWhat else can you do?\n---\nI\u2019m going to be here in the future.\n---\nYes, you\u2019re just not quite sure how.\n---\nThat\u2019s all rather worrying.",

The speaker notes that societal trends, particularly post-COVID, indicate a growing consumer interest in knowing the origins of their food, which could further support their vision. However, they also acknowledge the challenges posed by Brexit, particularly regarding the lack of processing capacity in the UK, which has led to a reliance on importing processed products. \n\nThe organization is aware of the financial constraints within the agricultural sector, as the banking industry has been hesitant to invest due to low profit margins. They emphasize the need for investment to develop processing capacity and ensure that farmers can effectively utilize their produce.

required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped.\n---\nAnd I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector.\n---\nSo, all

supermarkets, the customers.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not the public, it is the supermarkets.\n---\nAnd the government has got to say, \u2018No, enough is enough.\u2019\n---\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID?\n---\nAnything at all?\n---\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes \u2013 that side of things has done very well on the back of it.\n---\nSo, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s good.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not to the same scale as what we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\n---\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to

further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\n---\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what

the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI think there are two-three solutions to the problem.\n---\nOne, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to.\n---\nI think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back.\n---\nAnd these food miles are absolutely nuts.\n---\nIt\u2019s mad.\n---\nAnd yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nWe\u2019ll have no business left.\n---\nThe banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\n---\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really!\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down.\n---\nBut I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves.\n---\nWe need to be able survive\n---\nand we need to be competitive.\n---\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\n---\nYes.\n---\nAnd the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot.\n---\nPut it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\n---\nThat seems very clear.\n---\nAs we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\n---\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\n---\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s more money coming

we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\n---\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re not going to go quite back to the way you were before?\n---\nIt\u2019s going to be different?\n---\nIt\u2019ll certainly be different.\n---\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\n---\nYeah, it\u2019s killing agriculture big style.\n---\nIf all the manufacturers stop, it\u2019ll kill it.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s all very worrying.\n---\nWell, I hope things get better for you.\n---\nI\u2019ve come to the end of my questions now, you\u2019ve shed a lot of insight into what\u2019s sort of happening in this situation.\n---\nI wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\n---\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\n---\nWe\u2019ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that.\n---\nFind out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI think there are two-three solutions to the problem.\n---\nOne, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to.\n---\nI think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back.\n---\nAnd these food miles are absolutely nuts.\n---\nIt\u2019s mad.\n---\nAnd yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nWe\u2019ll have no business left.\n---\nThe banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\n---\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really!\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down.\n---\nBut I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves.\n---\nWe need to be able survive\n---\nand we need to be competitive.\n---\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\n---\nYes.\n---\nAnd the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot.\n---\nPut it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\n---\nThat seems very clear.\n---\nAs we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\n---\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\n---\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s more money coming back to the farm.\n---\nEND",
                    "contextualized_content": "The COVID crisis has had a profound impact on [org name] and the agricultural sector as a whole. With contracts being abruptly canceled, the organization faced a significant challenge in moving the required tonnage of potatoes, particularly as one-third of the potato industry supplies the food sector, which includes restaurants that suddenly ceased operations. This left a surplus of potatoes with no market, leading to concerns about waste and financial losses. As they plan for the upcoming harvest, uncertainty looms as customers hesitate to commit to contracts, creating a precarious situation for farmers who must continue planting without guaranteed sales. \n\nDespite these challenges, there have been some positive developments, such as the growth of small outlets and online sales, which have gained traction during the pandemic. However, the overall landscape remains daunting, with the combination of COVID and Brexit posing significant threats to the agricultural industry. The speaker emphasizes the need for local sourcing and investment to create a more resilient food system, advocating for a reduction in food miles and a more efficient distribution of resources to support farmers and ensure sustainability."

                    "original_content": "---\nThe factories, the customers \u2013 to be honest, the customers are quite happy paying a fair price for a good quality product.\n---\nThe problem is market prices \u2013 these dealers in the middle, and the factories, are really, when they can do, dropping the price for the farmers.\n---\nSo, we need to move closer to the end product where we can sustain a steady, average price for sustainability.\n---\nBecause in the last two years, we\u2019ve seen the base price collapse to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne.\n---\nAnd to give you an idea, we need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs, to break even.\n---\nAnd so, you can charge a fair price to the end customer whilst still getting enough profit to stay in business?\n---\nYes.\n---\nRight, good.\n---\nSo, we need to get close to then cut those rogues out the industry, really.\n---\nOkay, so it\u2019s cutting the rogues out.\n---\nSo, it sounds like you\u2019ve already taken the next step towards doing that by starting a direct-to-customer service?\n---\nYeah, that was done \u2013 we launched about four months\u2019 ago.\n---\nAnd this is basically the direction you\u2019re going in, to expand that part of the business?\n---\nIt\u2019s part of it yes.\n---\nObviously, there are different areas.\n---\nWe want more growers on board, more customers, and to grow that base we\u2019d need to add more of what we\u2019re doing and probably streamline what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s a three-way approach where we can drive out the inefficiencies, really.\n---\nAnd another thing, well as you know, things have changed quite recently \u2013 can you see any trends in society that could perhaps accelerate the vision that you\u2019ve just put forward, that might contribute to help?\n---\nObviously, COVID is a massive thing.\n---\nI do think there is more of an element of people wanting to know where it\u2019s come from.\n---\nAnd I think there is an element of people wanting that, but it\u2019s how you get the price and the customers to stop undermining everything we\u2019re doing in the UK, in the food industry.\n---\nBecause customers are willing to pay for it.\n---\nThey\u2019re willing to pay for quality.\n---\nBut, there\u2019s people within the system that will say, \u2018This is this,\u2019 but meanwhile bring some cheap stuff in the backdoor.\n---\nAnd that, as an industry, as a country, for food manufacturing areas we need to clamp down on.\n---\nI\u2019m wondering if Brexit is a factor?\n---\nIf it\u2019s harder to import things, would that be in your favour?\n---\nWell, it\u2019s harder to import things, definitely.\n---\nBut as a country we haven\u2019t got enough manufacturers to process the potatoes we have in the country anyway.\n---\nSo, we\u2019ve let it all go abroad, potatoes go to Belgium and then come back ready-made.\n---\nBut that might be more difficult.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s about developing manufacturing capacity to actually use what we already have?\n---\nWe use what here, we import a large amount of potatoes anyway, for ready-made meals and things like that.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the product to use, it\u2019s here in the country but we\u2019re not utilising it.\n---\nAnd the factories, the money has been invested in other countries, not the UK for processing potatoes.\n---\nAnd I know there\u2019s McCain\u2019s have reduced what they spend here, and [unclear \u2013 0:16:17:0] their major competitor take potatoes out of the UK, into Belgium, process them and they come back as a value pack for the supermarkets.\n---\nWhy are we allowing the road miles and everything else \u2013 it\u2019s crackers.\n---\nSo, it sounds like the bottle-neck is actually going to be processing capacity in the UK?\n---\nYes.\n---\nThe farmers are there, they\u2019ll do a good job.\n---\nThey\u2019re there to do it.\n---\nBut if they can\u2019t process what we produce, we\u2019re snookered.\n---\nWe\u2019re just flooding the market.\n---\nDo you think that [org name]  could actually, in any way, contribute towards helping with developing this processing capacity?\n---\nWe could, but the trouble with all these ideas is that they cost a lot of money.\n---\nAnd at a farm level, there isn\u2019t a lot of money left in the tank to be able to chuck at these things.\n---\nYou\u2019ve got to make your profits to then reinvest them.\n---\nAnd the banking industry is backing away from agriculture, because it\u2019s not seen as a very well \u2013 the profit margins are pathetic.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s building that to go forward.\n---\nMoney is key.\n---\nJust like a chicken and egg scenario, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nYes.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re aware of this issue but you might not be in a position personally to do much about it?\nExactly.\n---\nI can see the issue.\n---\nI know exactly what the issue is\n---\nand I know where you\u2019d take it forward.\n---\nBut without the investment or money to back what requires doing, it\u2019s a waste of time, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nSo, moving on a little bit more to financial issues, how resilient do you feel your organisation is?\n---\nHow stable do you think things might be, going forward in the next few years?\n---\nThe stability in [org name]  is fine.\n---\nThe stability in agriculture and farming is disastrous.\n---\nWithout the farmers and the potatoes, and supply what ever you\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not very stable.\n---\nThe problem is, manufacturing full stop.\n---\nIn this country I\u2019m hoping Brexit will change it but we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve got a good deal or a bad deal yet, do we?\n---\nIt\u2019s still evolving, yeah.\n---\nIt\u2019s a long way to go to get through this.\n---\nFarming is in a dire mess.\n---\nAnd that includes potatoes.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s not necessarily for the price, it\u2019s the weather patterns and everything.\n---\nIt\u2019s very, very difficult.\n---\nI\u2019m looking at things from two sides of the fence.\n---\nAnd so, which two sides?\n---\nThe side of the farmer, I\u2019ve a \u00a32 million turnover business farming.\n---\nAnd it\u2019s not paying.\n---\nAnd I\u2019m on the [org name] , the middle part of that is paying, but without farmers, you haven\u2019t got a business.\n---\nSo, this is basically the main risk, the whole farming industry in the UK after Brexit?\n---\nWe don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s going to go.\n---\nThere are very few farms in the last two or even three years that are actually profitable to a level that is satisfactory to a bank manager.\n---\nThat is worrying indeed.\n---\nAnd the banks are \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult for them to lend, if the business has a negative cash flow, through no fault of their own.\n---\nAnd there\u2019ll be a lot of businesses after COVID with the same scenario now.\n---\nWe\u2019ll come back to COVID in a moment, but in your answer to business and in [org name] , what sort of contingency plans to you have for the next few years, to deal with these risks?\n---\nThe contingency plan for the farm side of things is basically reduce what I\u2019m doing, because I cannot risk the losses.\n---\nSo, I\u2019m actually downscaling what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nReducing the farm size.\n---\nNow I\u2019m in my late 30\u2019s (nearly 40!), I should really be pushing things on.\n---\nYeah, building things up, developing them, yeah.\n---\nDeveloping, and actually, we doing quite the opposite.\n---\nI\u2019m doing the less.\n---\nFrom the [org name]  point of view, basically, I\u2019m getting more growers on board and spreading the risk out to more growers.\n---\nSo, the more growers we get, the less at risk we are.\n---\nSo, can reduce risk on the [org name]  side by diversifying, bringing in more growers, and on the farm side all you can do is down scale to a point at which you feel you can operate?\nWhich is downscale to a point at which it\u2019s manageable and we can guarantee sales through all of our products we produce.\n---\nWhat else can you do?\n---\nI\u2019m going to be here in the future.\n---\nYes, you\u2019re just not quite sure how.\n---\nThat\u2019s all rather worrying.",

The speaker notes that societal trends, particularly post-COVID, indicate a growing consumer interest in knowing the origins of their food, which could further support their vision. However, they also acknowledge the challenges posed by Brexit, particularly regarding the lack of processing capacity in the UK, which has led to a reliance on importing processed products. \n\nThe organization is aware of the financial constraints within the agricultural sector, as the banking industry has been hesitant to invest due to low profit margins. They emphasize the need for investment to develop processing capacity and ensure that farmers can effectively utilize their produce. The speaker expresses concern about the overall stability of agriculture in the UK, especially in light of recent challenges, and highlights the importance of diversifying their grower base to mitigate risks."

organisation?\n---\n[org name] , as an organisation, we had contracts \u2013 our customers basically tore up in front of us.\n---\nFor supply, we\u2019ve basically not been able to move the tonnage required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped.\n---\nAnd I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector.\n---\nSo, all of a sudden, we had a lot of potatoes sat there with no homes.\n---\nThat was a major effect.\n---\nTo the point after the lockdown now, this sector doesn\u2019t require the potatoes.\n---\nAnd we\u2019re planning now for 2021/2022 harvest and to be quite honest we\u2019ve got customers who won\u2019t sign a contract with us until they know more about what is going to happen.\n---\nBut as a farmer, you have to buy the seed, you have to plant the potatoes, you can\u2019t stop.\n---\nBut the customers are just saying, \u2018Well, not sure.\n---\nPlant them \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know later in the year whether we\u2019re going to take them or not.\u2019\n---\nAre you fearing you might end up with a pile of potatoes you can\u2019t sell to anybody?\nAbsolutely.\n---\nThousands of tonnes of potatoes in the ground and in sheds which will not get processed or used.\n---\nThey\u2019ll just get wasted.\n---\nI wonder if the Direct to Customer service could help here?\n---\nIf you could get some straight to the customers, would that help?\n---\nThere is an element of that, but there are a lot of people who don\u2019t use potatoes \u2013 the cooking at home is rice, it\u2019s pasta.\n---\nCertainly, don\u2019t want to be importing stuff, which is what\u2019s coming up.\n---\nSo, if you want to help the British farmers, the supermarkets, the factories need to stop importing stuff.\n---\nAnd start taking things from British suppliers.\n---\nSo, is [org name]  a suitable venue to publicise this, to actually say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got all this stuff, you don\u2019t need to go abroad\u2019?\n---\nWell, it is, but we\u2019re probably not a big enough player.\n---\nWhen you\u2019re talking to the likes of McCain\u2019s, and Walkers, and those sorts of people, they\u2019re a multinational company anyway, they have suppliers from all over the place.\n---\nIt\u2019s got to come from government level really, to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019\n---\nOr the supermarkets, the customers.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not the public, it is the supermarkets.\n---\nAnd the government has got to say, \u2018No, enough is enough.\u2019\n---\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID?\n---\nAnything at all?\n---\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes \u2013 that side of things has done very well on the back of it.\n---\nSo, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s good.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not to the same scale as what we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\n---\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re not going to go quite back to the way you were before?\n---\nIt\u2019s going to be different?\n---\nIt\u2019ll certainly be different.\n---\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\n---\nYeah, it\u2019s killing agriculture big style.\n---\nIf all the manufacturers stop, it\u2019ll kill it.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s all very worrying.\n---\nWell, I hope things get better for you.\n---\nI\u2019ve come to the end of my questions now, you\u2019ve shed a lot of insight into what\u2019s sort of happening in this situation.\n---\nI wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\n---\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\n---\nWe\u2019ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that.\n---\nFind out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI think there are two-three solutions to the problem.\n---\nOne, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to.\n---\nI think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back.\n---\nAnd these food miles are absolutely nuts.\n---\nIt\u2019s mad.\n---\nAnd yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nWe\u2019ll have no business left.\n---\nThe banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\n---\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really!\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down.\n---\nBut I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves.\n---\nWe need to be able survive\n---\nand we need to be competitive.\n---\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\n---\nYes.\n---\nAnd the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot.\n---\nPut it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\n---\nThat seems very clear.\n---\nAs we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\n---\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\n---\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s more money coming back to the farm.\n---\nEND",
                    "contextualized_content": "The COVID crisis has had a profound impact on [org name] and the agricultural sector as a whole. With contracts being abruptly canceled, the organization faced a significant challenge in moving the required tonnage of potatoes, particularly as one-third of the potato industry supplies the food sector, which includes restaurants that suddenly ceased operations. This left a surplus of potatoes with no market, leading to concerns about waste and financial losses. As they plan for the upcoming harvest, uncertainty looms as customers hesitate to commit to contracts, creating a precarious situation for farmers who must continue planting without guaranteed sales. \n\nDespite these challenges, there have been some positive developments, such as the growth of small outlets and online sales, which have gained traction during the pandemic. However, the overall landscape remains daunting, with the combination of COVID and Brexit posing significant threats to the agricultural industry. The speaker emphasizes the need for local sourcing and investment to create a more resilient food system, advocating for a reduction in food miles and a more efficient distribution of resources to support farmers and ensure sustainability."

                    "original_content": "Could you say a little bit about your organisation\u2019s activities?\n---\nWhen you say that, do you mean the farm side or the [org name] ?\n---\nI think the [org name].\n---\n[org name] is 3 farmers, we all grow potatoes.\n---\nWe are all selling individually, and what we\u2019re trying to do is come together to make an organisation basically, where all our potatoes are bought centrally and marketed all together.\n---\nSo, fundamentally, we brought in a trader to take the burden out of the individual farms and get closer to the customers, because the customers don\u2019t really want to deal with the farms, they would rather go through an organisation.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s like an interface between the farmers and the customers?\n---\nYes, basically, somewhere in the middle it\u2019s owned by the farmers.\n---\nSet up for the farmers.\n---\nAnd the idea is by taking the middle man out, we are the middle man.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re taking the middle man out from between the farmers and the market?\n---\nYes.\n---\nWe are the traders in the middle.\n---\nThat\u2019s great.\n---\nWhat\u2019s your personal involvement in this?\n---\nWhat role do you play?\n---\nWhen the factory wants loads, well, rather than going to individual farms, we manage their supply into the factory.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s about ten-fifteen farms, supplying in.\n---\nAnd we manage that supply so that there\u2019s a steady supply of potatoes rather than odds and sods here and there.\n---\nThen obviously, they pay [org name]  and [org name]  distributes the money out to the farmers.\n---\nSo, I believe you operate on a local level?\n---\nThe main core of the group is local.\n---\nBut then we do supply factories all over the country.\n---\nAnd we buy potatoes from all over the country as well, on an ad hoc basis, so we can supply all year round because potatoes arrive at different periods of the year.\n---\nAnd obviously, we want to supply the factories all year round, and they want a supply all year round.\n---\nSo, we buy from other farms as well, which supply at different times of year, it varies.\n---\nIs this nationally, or do you do anything with factories or suppliers in other countries?\n---\nWe do a little bit.\n---\nWe have exported in the past.\n---\nNot much this year.\n---\nLast year we were exporting and importing.\n---\nBut it\u2019s only really to fill any gaps.\n---\nWhen we have extreme heat, or anything like that, we just fill in gaps when there\u2019s surplus, things like that.\n---\nSo, you operate locally, regionally and nationally.\n---\nBut internationally when you have to, when there\u2019s a gap?\n---\nYeah, when there are too many potatoes here, we have exported to Poland, exported to Ireland and Belgium quite a bit.\n---\nBut that\u2019s not a regular thing, that\u2019s just when the market requires it, if there\u2019s an opportunity we have to grab it.\n---\nHow would you consider yourself to be innovative?\n---\nWhat do you feel you are doing differently?\n---\nInitially we had to go through somewhere else other than [org name] and there is a lot of money in the middle man.\n---\nAnd basically, the idea was that we cut out the middle man and all that money comes back to the farm.\n---\nSo, we\u2019re not there to make money, we\u2019re there to pass the money back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that is the crux of the industry that has not been happening.\n---\nThe money going back to farmers \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s not been happening?\n---\nIt\u2019s not been going back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s what you aim to address?\n---\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to deal with.\n---\nAnd since we\u2019ve become in the area, doing what we\u2019re doing, these other mergers in the middle are taking the mass market out because they have to compete.\n---\nSo, are you saying there\u2019s now competition?\n---\nThere\u2019s more competition in the area.\n---\nSo, people have seen that it\u2019s a good idea and they want in on it?\n---\nYes, as it were.\n---\nI\u2019ve just obeyed the company really.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got a lot to do, to get to where we want to get to.\n---\nIt\u2019s certainly helping.\n---\nObviously, after Covid it\u2019s been a challenging year.\nIndeed.\n---\nSo, in terms of collaborators \u2013 well you\u2019ve touched on competition, but considering who you\u2019re collaborating with at the moment, there\u2019s the three farms and other suppliers?\n---\nThere\u2019s three farms that are direct suppliers, and then we have contractual other farms, basically guaranteeing us their spuds, contracted into the group.\n---\nAnd we supply factories like Walkers, McCains, Seabrooks \u2013 various crisps, all those sorts of people.\n---\n[unclear] Food, we do a little bit of pre-packaged for supermarkets with Morrison\u2019s and different people.\n---\n[unclear 0:08:51.0]\nAnd you\u2019ve explained that your role in this network is bypassing the middle man and making sure that the most profit goes from the customers back to the farmers?\n---\nYes, basically.\n---\nWho amongst the people you\u2019re working with, who are crucial?\n---\nWith the other people who you\u2019ve mentioned, who you\u2019re collaborating with, are they all crucial to the functioning of [org name] ?\n---\nNo, not the day-to-day running of it.\n---\nI\u2019m obviously managing the office with staff.\n---\nThey are obviously directors of the business, interested in how it works, but the day-to-day management comes back to me and the staff.\n---\nIs that what you mean?\n---\nYes, so what you\u2019re saying is that if a supplier dropped out, you could find a different supplier, and things like that?\n---\nYes, obviously the crucial thing is suppliers and farmers.\n---\nIf you haven\u2019t got them, or enough of them to supply the demand you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nSo, they\u2019re the important ones?\n---\nYes.\n---\nPlus, of course, the people who like yourself, are actually running the organisation, running the outfit?\n---\nWho\u2019s crucial within who runs it?\n---\nI think you just mentioned the people who are managing it?\n---\nYeah, that\u2019s me, we\u2019re the crucial ones.\n---\nWell, if we don\u2019t do what we do then someone else will do it.\n---\nBut yeah, we are the ones making it work.\n---\nSo, I think, looking a little bit towards the future, if you consider the next few years, and for the longer term, perhaps the next fifteen years, what would you say is your vision for what you might call, \u2018Future Food Systems\u2019?\n---\nMy vision for the future \u2013 I think sustainability is the key to anything.\n---\nIf we don\u2019t have sustainability, we\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nI want to bring more farmers on board, to grow our members; to see the benefits of what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nAnd also, to look at taking this \u2013 we\u2019ve just started off a 7.5kg bag line, it\u2019s a new thing for us, getting closer to the customer, and I think we\u2019ll look at something else to get closer to the customer really and cut the factories out, where we become further down the chain.\n---\nThe closer to the customer we get, the more we\u2019ll get back to the farm.\n---\nSo, ultimately you would have a process that would take the produce directly from the farm, straight to the end customer?\n---\nThat is the ultimate.\n---\nI think rather than just selling the potato, we\u2019ll slice it, and things like that.\n---\nOr we\u2019ll put it into ready-made meals.\n---\nWell maybe not that, but get it ready to go closer to the end user.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re sort of gradually, as you mentioned, bypassing elements of the chain, starting recently with going direct to consumer and that\u2019s the direction you want to take in the future?\n---\nI think one thing is the scale, we need to increase the volumes we trade as a group.\n---\nAnd on the other side we need an avenue where we get closer to the customer, to take the volatility out of the job.\n---\nAnd how do you feel this will contribute to sustainability?\nBecause you\u2019ve got [unclear] contracts in front of you.",
                    "contextualized_content": "The organization, referred to as [org name], consists of three farmers who specialize in potato cultivation. They are working collaboratively to centralize the purchasing and marketing of their potatoes, which allows them to streamline operations and reduce reliance on traditional middlemen. By bringing in a trader, they aim to alleviate the burden on individual farms and connect more directly with customers, who prefer dealing with an organization rather than multiple individual farms. This setup not only enhances efficiency but also ensures that profits are returned to the farmers, addressing a significant issue in the agricultural sector where farmers often see little of the profits generated from their produce. The organization operates primarily on a local level but also engages in regional and national supply, and occasionally exports to fill market gaps. Their innovative approach focuses on sustainability and direct sales to consumers, which they believe will further enhance their profitability and stability in the long term."

market prices \u2013 these dealers in the middle, and the factories, are really, when they can do, dropping the price for the farmers.\n---\nSo, we need to move closer to the end product where we can sustain a steady, average price for sustainability.\n---\nBecause in the last two years, we\u2019ve seen the base price collapse to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne.\n---\nAnd to give you an idea, we need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs, to break even.\n---\nAnd so, you can charge a fair price to the end customer whilst still getting enough profit to stay in business?\n---\nYes.\n---\nRight, good.\n---\nSo, we need to get close to then cut those rogues out the industry, really.\n---\nOkay, so it\u2019s cutting the rogues out.\n---\nSo, it sounds like you\u2019ve already taken the next step towards doing that by starting a direct-to-customer service?\n---\nYeah, that was done \u2013 we launched about four months\u2019 ago.\n---\nAnd this is basically the direction you\u2019re going in, to expand that part of the business?\n---\nIt\u2019s part of it yes.\n---\nObviously, there are different areas.\n---\nWe want more growers on board, more customers, and to grow that base we\u2019d need to add more of what we\u2019re doing and probably streamline what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s a three-way approach where we can drive out the inefficiencies, really.\n---\nAnd another thing, well as you know, things have changed quite recently \u2013 can you see any trends in society that could perhaps accelerate the vision that you\u2019ve just put forward, that might contribute to help?\n---\nObviously, COVID is a massive thing.\n---\nI do think there is more of an element of people wanting to know where it\u2019s come from.\n---\nAnd I think there is an element of people wanting that, but it\u2019s how you get the price and the customers to stop undermining everything we\u2019re doing in the UK, in the food industry.\n---\nBecause customers are willing to pay for it.\n---\nThey\u2019re willing to pay for quality.\n---\nBut, there\u2019s people within the system that will say, \u2018This is this,\u2019 but meanwhile bring some cheap stuff in the backdoor.\n---\nAnd that, as an industry, as a country, for food manufacturing areas we need to clamp down on.\n---\nI\u2019m wondering if Brexit is a factor?\n---\nIf it\u2019s harder to import things, would that be in your favour?\n---\nWell, it\u2019s harder to import things, definitely.\n---\nBut as a country we haven\u2019t got enough manufacturers to process the potatoes we have in the country anyway.\n---\nSo, we\u2019ve let it all go abroad, potatoes go to Belgium and then come back ready-made.\n---\nBut that might be more difficult.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s about developing manufacturing capacity to actually use what we already have?\n---\nWe use what here, we import a large amount of potatoes anyway, for ready-made meals and things like that.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the product to use, it\u2019s here in the country but we\u2019re not utilising it.\n---\nAnd the factories, the money has been invested in other countries, not the UK for processing potatoes.\n---\nAnd I know there\u2019s McCain\u2019s have reduced what they spend here, and [unclear \u2013 0:16:17:0] their major competitor take potatoes out of the UK, into Belgium, process them and they come back as a value pack for the supermarkets.\n---\nWhy are we allowing the road miles and everything else \u2013 it\u2019s crackers.\n---\nSo, it sounds like the bottle-neck is actually going to be processing capacity in the UK?\n---\nYes.\n---\nThe farmers are there, they\u2019ll do a good job.\n---\nThey\u2019re there to do it.\n---\nBut if they can\u2019t process what we produce, we\u2019re snookered.\n---\nWe\u2019re just flooding the market.\n---\nDo you think that [org name]  could actually, in any way, contribute towards helping with developing this processing capacity?\n---\nWe could, but the trouble with all these ideas is that they cost a lot of money.\n---\nAnd at a farm level, there isn\u2019t a lot of money left in the tank to be able to chuck at these things.\n---\nYou\u2019ve got to make your profits to then reinvest them.\n---\nAnd the banking industry is backing away from agriculture, because it\u2019s not seen as a very well \u2013 the profit margins are pathetic.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s building that to go forward.\n---\nMoney is key.\n---\nJust like a chicken and egg scenario, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nYes.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re aware of this issue but you might not be in a position personally to do much about it?\nExactly.\n---\nI can see the issue.\n---\nI know exactly what the issue is\n---\nand I know where you\u2019d take it forward.\n---\nBut without the investment or money to back what requires doing, it\u2019s a waste of time, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nSo, moving on a little bit more to financial issues, how resilient do you feel your organisation is?\n---\nHow stable do you think things might be, going forward in the next few years?\n---\nThe stability in [org name]  is fine.\n---\nThe stability in agriculture and farming is disastrous.\n---\nWithout the farmers and the potatoes, and supply what ever you\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not very stable.\n---\nThe problem is, manufacturing full stop.\n---\nIn this country I\u2019m hoping Brexit will change it but we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve got a good deal or a bad deal yet, do we?\n---\nIt\u2019s still evolving, yeah.\n---\nIt\u2019s a long way to go to get through this.\n---\nFarming is in a dire mess.\n---\nAnd that includes potatoes.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s not necessarily for the price, it\u2019s the weather patterns and everything.\n---\nIt\u2019s very, very difficult.\n---\nI\u2019m looking at things from two sides of the fence.\n---\nAnd so, which two sides?\n---\nThe side of the farmer, I\u2019ve a \u00a32 million turnover business farming.\n---\nAnd it\u2019s not paying.\n---\nAnd I\u2019m on the [org name] , the middle part of that is paying, but without farmers, you haven\u2019t got a business.\n---\nSo, this is basically the main risk, the whole farming industry in the UK after Brexit?\n---\nWe don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s going to go.\n---\nThere are very few farms in the last two or even three years that are actually profitable to a level that is satisfactory to a bank manager.\n---\nThat is worrying indeed.\n---\nAnd the banks are \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult for them to lend, if the business has a negative cash flow, through no fault of their own.\n---\nAnd there\u2019ll be a lot of businesses after COVID with the same scenario now.\n---\nWe\u2019ll come back to COVID in a moment, but in your answer to business and in [org name] , what sort of contingency plans to you have for the next few years, to deal with these risks?\n---\nThe contingency plan for the farm side of things is basically reduce what I\u2019m doing, because I cannot risk the losses.\n---\nSo, I\u2019m actually downscaling what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nReducing the farm size.\n---\nNow I\u2019m in my late 30\u2019s (nearly 40!), I should really be pushing things on.\n---\nYeah, building things up, developing them, yeah.\n---\nDeveloping, and actually, we doing quite the opposite.\n---\nI\u2019m doing the less.\n---\nFrom the [org name]  point of view, basically, I\u2019m getting more growers on board and spreading the risk out to more growers.\n---\nSo, the more growers we get, the less at risk we are.\n---\nSo, can reduce risk on the [org name]  side by diversifying, bringing in more growers, and on the farm side all you can do is down scale to a point at which you feel you can operate?\nWhich is downscale to a point at which it\u2019s manageable and we can guarantee sales through all of our products we produce.\n---\nWhat else can you do?\n---\nI\u2019m going to be here in the future.\n---\nYes, you\u2019re just not quite sure how.\n---\nThat\u2019s all rather worrying.",

However, they also acknowledge the challenges posed by Brexit, particularly regarding the lack of processing capacity in the UK, which has led to a reliance on importing processed products. \n\nThe organization is aware of the financial constraints within the agricultural sector, as the banking industry has been hesitant to invest due to low profit margins. They emphasize the need for investment to develop processing capacity and ensure that farmers can effectively utilize their produce.

organisation?\n---\n[org name] , as an organisation, we had contracts \u2013 our customers basically tore up in front of us.\n---\nFor supply, we\u2019ve basically not been able to move the tonnage required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped.\n---\nAnd I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector.\n---\nSo, all of a sudden, we had a lot of potatoes sat there with no homes.\n---\nThat was a major effect.\n---\nTo the point after the lockdown now, this sector doesn\u2019t require the potatoes.\n---\nAnd we\u2019re planning now for 2021/2022 harvest and to be quite honest we\u2019ve got customers who won\u2019t sign a contract with us until they know more about what is going to happen.\n---\nBut as a farmer, you have to buy the seed, you have to plant the potatoes, you can\u2019t stop.\n---\nBut the customers are just saying, \u2018Well, not sure.\n---\nPlant them \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know later in the year whether we\u2019re going to take them or not.\u2019\n---\nAre you fearing you might end up with a pile of potatoes you can\u2019t sell to anybody?\nAbsolutely.\n---\nThousands of tonnes of potatoes in the ground and in sheds which will not get processed or used.\n---\nThey\u2019ll just get wasted.\n---\nI wonder if the Direct to Customer service could help here?\n---\nIf you could get some straight to the customers, would that help?\n---\nThere is an element of that, but there are a lot of people who don\u2019t use potatoes \u2013 the cooking at home is rice, it\u2019s pasta.\n---\nCertainly, don\u2019t want to be importing stuff, which is what\u2019s coming up.\n---\nSo, if you want to help the British farmers, the supermarkets, the factories need to stop importing stuff.\n---\nAnd start taking things from British suppliers.\n---\nSo, is [org name]  a suitable venue to publicise this, to actually say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got all this stuff, you don\u2019t need to go abroad\u2019?\n---\nWell, it is, but we\u2019re probably not a big enough player.\n---\nWhen you\u2019re talking to the likes of McCain\u2019s, and Walkers, and those sorts of people, they\u2019re a multinational company anyway, they have suppliers from all over the place.\n---\nIt\u2019s got to come from government level really, to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019\n---\nOr the supermarkets, the customers.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not the public, it is the supermarkets.\n---\nAnd the government has got to say, \u2018No, enough is enough.\u2019\n---\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID?\n---\nAnything at all?\n---\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes \u2013 that side of things has done very well on the back of it.\n---\nSo, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s good.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not to the same scale as what we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\n---\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re not going to go quite back to the way you were before?\n---\nIt\u2019s going to be different?\n---\nIt\u2019ll certainly be different.\n---\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\n---\nYeah, it\u2019s killing agriculture big style.\n---\nIf all the manufacturers stop, it\u2019ll kill it.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s all very worrying.\n---\nWell, I hope things get better for you.\n---\nI\u2019ve come to the end of my questions now, you\u2019ve shed a lot of insight into what\u2019s sort of happening in this situation.\n---\nI wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\n---\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\n---\nWe\u2019ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that.\n---\nFind out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI think there are two-three solutions to the problem.\n---\nOne, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to.\n---\nI think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back.\n---\nAnd these food miles are absolutely nuts.\n---\nIt\u2019s mad.\n---\nAnd yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nWe\u2019ll have no business left.\n---\nThe banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\n---\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really!\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down.\n---\nBut I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves.\n---\nWe need to be able survive\n---\nand we need to be competitive.\n---\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\n---\nYes.\n---\nAnd the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot.\n---\nPut it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\n---\nThat seems very clear.\n---\nAs we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\n---\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\n---\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s more money coming back to the farm.\n---\nEND",
                    "contextualized_content": "The COVID crisis has had a profound impact on [org name] and the agricultural sector as a whole. With contracts being abruptly canceled, the organization faced a significant challenge in moving the required tonnage of potatoes, particularly as one-third of the potato industry supplies the food sector, which includes restaurants that suddenly ceased operations. This left a surplus of potatoes with no market, leading to concerns about waste and financial losses. As they plan for the upcoming harvest, uncertainty looms as customers hesitate to commit to contracts, creating a precarious situation for farmers who must continue planting without guaranteed sales. \n\nDespite these challenges, there have been some positive developments, such as the growth of small outlets and online sales, which have gained traction during the pandemic. However, the overall landscape remains daunting, with the combination of COVID and Brexit posing significant threats to the agricultural industry. The speaker emphasizes the need for local sourcing and investment to create a more resilient food system, advocating for a reduction in food miles and a more efficient distribution of resources to support farmers and ensure sustainability."

                    "original_content": "---\nThe factories, the customers \u2013 to be honest, the customers are quite happy paying a fair price for a good quality product.\n---\nThe problem is market prices \u2013 these dealers in the middle, and the factories, are really, when they can do, dropping the price for the farmers.\n---\nSo, we need to move closer to the end product where we can sustain a steady, average price for sustainability.\n---\nBecause in the last two years, we\u2019ve seen the base price collapse to \u00a330-\u00a340 per tonne.\n---\nAnd to give you an idea, we need \u00a3100-\u00a3110 per tonne to cover costs, to break even.\n---\nAnd so, you can charge a fair price to the end customer whilst still getting enough profit to stay in business?\n---\nYes.\n---\nRight, good.\n---\nSo, we need to get close to then cut those rogues out the industry, really.\n---\nOkay, so it\u2019s cutting the rogues out.\n---\nSo, it sounds like you\u2019ve already taken the next step towards doing that by starting a direct-to-customer service?\n---\nYeah, that was done \u2013 we launched about four months\u2019 ago.\n---\nAnd this is basically the direction you\u2019re going in, to expand that part of the business?\n---\nIt\u2019s part of it yes.\n---\nObviously, there are different areas.\n---\nWe want more growers on board, more customers, and to grow that base we\u2019d need to add more of what we\u2019re doing and probably streamline what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s a three-way approach where we can drive out the inefficiencies, really.\n---\nAnd another thing, well as you know, things have changed quite recently \u2013 can you see any trends in society that could perhaps accelerate the vision that you\u2019ve just put forward, that might contribute to help?\n---\nObviously, COVID is a massive thing.\n---\nI do think there is more of an element of people wanting to know where it\u2019s come from.\n---\nAnd I think there is an element of people wanting that, but it\u2019s how you get the price and the customers to stop undermining everything we\u2019re doing in the UK, in the food industry.\n---\nBecause customers are willing to pay for it.\n---\nThey\u2019re willing to pay for quality.\n---\nBut, there\u2019s people within the system that will say, \u2018This is this,\u2019 but meanwhile bring some cheap stuff in the backdoor.\n---\nAnd that, as an industry, as a country, for food manufacturing areas we need to clamp down on.\n---\nI\u2019m wondering if Brexit is a factor?\n---\nIf it\u2019s harder to import things, would that be in your favour?\n---\nWell, it\u2019s harder to import things, definitely.\n---\nBut as a country we haven\u2019t got enough manufacturers to process the potatoes we have in the country anyway.\n---\nSo, we\u2019ve let it all go abroad, potatoes go to Belgium and then come back ready-made.\n---\nBut that might be more difficult.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s about developing manufacturing capacity to actually use what we already have?\n---\nWe use what here, we import a large amount of potatoes anyway, for ready-made meals and things like that.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the product to use, it\u2019s here in the country but we\u2019re not utilising it.\n---\nAnd the factories, the money has been invested in other countries, not the UK for processing potatoes.\n---\nAnd I know there\u2019s McCain\u2019s have reduced what they spend here, and [unclear \u2013 0:16:17:0] their major competitor take potatoes out of the UK, into Belgium, process them and they come back as a value pack for the supermarkets.\n---\nWhy are we allowing the road miles and everything else \u2013 it\u2019s crackers.\n---\nSo, it sounds like the bottle-neck is actually going to be processing capacity in the UK?\n---\nYes.\n---\nThe farmers are there, they\u2019ll do a good job.\n---\nThey\u2019re there to do it.\n---\nBut if they can\u2019t process what we produce, we\u2019re snookered.\n---\nWe\u2019re just flooding the market.\n---\nDo you think that [org name]  could actually, in any way, contribute towards helping with developing this processing capacity?\n---\nWe could, but the trouble with all these ideas is that they cost a lot of money.\n---\nAnd at a farm level, there isn\u2019t a lot of money left in the tank to be able to chuck at these things.\n---\nYou\u2019ve got to make your profits to then reinvest them.\n---\nAnd the banking industry is backing away from agriculture, because it\u2019s not seen as a very well \u2013 the profit margins are pathetic.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s building that to go forward.\n---\nMoney is key.\n---\nJust like a chicken and egg scenario, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nYes.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re aware of this issue but you might not be in a position personally to do much about it?\nExactly.\n---\nI can see the issue.\n---\nI know exactly what the issue is\n---\nand I know where you\u2019d take it forward.\n---\nBut without the investment or money to back what requires doing, it\u2019s a waste of time, isn\u2019t it?\n---\nSo, moving on a little bit more to financial issues, how resilient do you feel your organisation is?\n---\nHow stable do you think things might be, going forward in the next few years?\n---\nThe stability in [org name]  is fine.\n---\nThe stability in agriculture and farming is disastrous.\n---\nWithout the farmers and the potatoes, and supply what ever you\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not very stable.\n---\nThe problem is, manufacturing full stop.\n---\nIn this country I\u2019m hoping Brexit will change it but we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019ve got a good deal or a bad deal yet, do we?\n---\nIt\u2019s still evolving, yeah.\n---\nIt\u2019s a long way to go to get through this.\n---\nFarming is in a dire mess.\n---\nAnd that includes potatoes.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s not necessarily for the price, it\u2019s the weather patterns and everything.\n---\nIt\u2019s very, very difficult.\n---\nI\u2019m looking at things from two sides of the fence.\n---\nAnd so, which two sides?\n---\nThe side of the farmer, I\u2019ve a \u00a32 million turnover business farming.\n---\nAnd it\u2019s not paying.\n---\nAnd I\u2019m on the [org name] , the middle part of that is paying, but without farmers, you haven\u2019t got a business.\n---\nSo, this is basically the main risk, the whole farming industry in the UK after Brexit?\n---\nWe don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s going to go.\n---\nThere are very few farms in the last two or even three years that are actually profitable to a level that is satisfactory to a bank manager.\n---\nThat is worrying indeed.\n---\nAnd the banks are \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult for them to lend, if the business has a negative cash flow, through no fault of their own.\n---\nAnd there\u2019ll be a lot of businesses after COVID with the same scenario now.\n---\nWe\u2019ll come back to COVID in a moment, but in your answer to business and in [org name] , what sort of contingency plans to you have for the next few years, to deal with these risks?\n---\nThe contingency plan for the farm side of things is basically reduce what I\u2019m doing, because I cannot risk the losses.\n---\nSo, I\u2019m actually downscaling what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nReducing the farm size.\n---\nNow I\u2019m in my late 30\u2019s (nearly 40!), I should really be pushing things on.\n---\nYeah, building things up, developing them, yeah.\n---\nDeveloping, and actually, we doing quite the opposite.\n---\nI\u2019m doing the less.\n---\nFrom the [org name]  point of view, basically, I\u2019m getting more growers on board and spreading the risk out to more growers.\n---\nSo, the more growers we get, the less at risk we are.\n---\nSo, can reduce risk on the [org name]  side by diversifying, bringing in more growers, and on the farm side all you can do is down scale to a point at which you feel you can operate?\nWhich is downscale to a point at which it\u2019s manageable and we can guarantee sales through all of our products we produce.\n---\nWhat else can you do?\n---\nI\u2019m going to be here in the future.\n---\nYes, you\u2019re just not quite sure how.\n---\nThat\u2019s all rather worrying.",

However, they also acknowledge the challenges posed by Brexit, particularly regarding the lack of processing capacity in the UK, which has led to a reliance on importing processed products. \n\nThe organization is aware of the financial constraints within the agricultural sector, as the banking industry has been hesitant to invest due to low profit margins.

                    "original_content": "Could you say a little bit about your organisation\u2019s activities?\n---\nWhen you say that, do you mean the farm side or the [org name] ?\n---\nI think the [org name].\n---\n[org name] is 3 farmers, we all grow potatoes.\n---\nWe are all selling individually, and what we\u2019re trying to do is come together to make an organisation basically, where all our potatoes are bought centrally and marketed all together.\n---\nSo, fundamentally, we brought in a trader to take the burden out of the individual farms and get closer to the customers, because the customers don\u2019t really want to deal with the farms, they would rather go through an organisation.\n---\nSo, it\u2019s like an interface between the farmers and the customers?\n---\nYes, basically, somewhere in the middle it\u2019s owned by the farmers.\n---\nSet up for the farmers.\n---\nAnd the idea is by taking the middle man out, we are the middle man.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re taking the middle man out from between the farmers and the market?\n---\nYes.\n---\nWe are the traders in the middle.\n---\nThat\u2019s great.\n---\nWhat\u2019s your personal involvement in this?\n---\nWhat role do you play?\n---\nWhen the factory wants loads, well, rather than going to individual farms, we manage their supply into the factory.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s about ten-fifteen farms, supplying in.\n---\nAnd we manage that supply so that there\u2019s a steady supply of potatoes rather than odds and sods here and there.\n---\nThen obviously, they pay [org name]  and [org name]  distributes the money out to the farmers.\n---\nSo, I believe you operate on a local level?\n---\nThe main core of the group is local.\n---\nBut then we do supply factories all over the country.\n---\nAnd we buy potatoes from all over the country as well, on an ad hoc basis, so we can supply all year round because potatoes arrive at different periods of the year.\n---\nAnd obviously, we want to supply the factories all year round, and they want a supply all year round.\n---\nSo, we buy from other farms as well, which supply at different times of year, it varies.\n---\nIs this nationally, or do you do anything with factories or suppliers in other countries?\n---\nWe do a little bit.\n---\nWe have exported in the past.\n---\nNot much this year.\n---\nLast year we were exporting and importing.\n---\nBut it\u2019s only really to fill any gaps.\n---\nWhen we have extreme heat, or anything like that, we just fill in gaps when there\u2019s surplus, things like that.\n---\nSo, you operate locally, regionally and nationally.\n---\nBut internationally when you have to, when there\u2019s a gap?\n---\nYeah, when there are too many potatoes here, we have exported to Poland, exported to Ireland and Belgium quite a bit.\n---\nBut that\u2019s not a regular thing, that\u2019s just when the market requires it, if there\u2019s an opportunity we have to grab it.\n---\nHow would you consider yourself to be innovative?\n---\nWhat do you feel you are doing differently?\n---\nInitially we had to go through somewhere else other than [org name] and there is a lot of money in the middle man.\n---\nAnd basically, the idea was that we cut out the middle man and all that money comes back to the farm.\n---\nSo, we\u2019re not there to make money, we\u2019re there to pass the money back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that is the crux of the industry that has not been happening.\n---\nThe money going back to farmers \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s not been happening?\n---\nIt\u2019s not been going back to the farmer.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s what you aim to address?\n---\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to deal with.\n---\nAnd since we\u2019ve become in the area, doing what we\u2019re doing, these other mergers in the middle are taking the mass market out because they have to compete.\n---\nSo, are you saying there\u2019s now competition?\n---\nThere\u2019s more competition in the area.\n---\nSo, people have seen that it\u2019s a good idea and they want in on it?\n---\nYes, as it were.\n---\nI\u2019ve just obeyed the company really.\n---\nWe\u2019ve got a lot to do, to get to where we want to get to.\n---\nIt\u2019s certainly helping.\n---\nObviously, after Covid it\u2019s been a challenging year.\nIndeed.\n---\nSo, in terms of collaborators \u2013 well you\u2019ve touched on competition, but considering who you\u2019re collaborating with at the moment, there\u2019s the three farms and other suppliers?\n---\nThere\u2019s three farms that are direct suppliers, and then we have contractual other farms, basically guaranteeing us their spuds, contracted into the group.\n---\nAnd we supply factories like Walkers, McCains, Seabrooks \u2013 various crisps, all those sorts of people.\n---\n[unclear] Food, we do a little bit of pre-packaged for supermarkets with Morrison\u2019s and different people.\n---\n[unclear 0:08:51.0]\nAnd you\u2019ve explained that your role in this network is bypassing the middle man and making sure that the most profit goes from the customers back to the farmers?\n---\nYes, basically.\n---\nWho amongst the people you\u2019re working with, who are crucial?\n---\nWith the other people who you\u2019ve mentioned, who you\u2019re collaborating with, are they all crucial to the functioning of [org name] ?\n---\nNo, not the day-to-day running of it.\n---\nI\u2019m obviously managing the office with staff.\n---\nThey are obviously directors of the business, interested in how it works, but the day-to-day management comes back to me and the staff.\n---\nIs that what you mean?\n---\nYes, so what you\u2019re saying is that if a supplier dropped out, you could find a different supplier, and things like that?\n---\nYes, obviously the crucial thing is suppliers and farmers.\n---\nIf you haven\u2019t got them, or enough of them to supply the demand you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nSo, they\u2019re the important ones?\n---\nYes.\n---\nPlus, of course, the people who like yourself, are actually running the organisation, running the outfit?\n---\nWho\u2019s crucial within who runs it?\n---\nI think you just mentioned the people who are managing it?\n---\nYeah, that\u2019s me, we\u2019re the crucial ones.\n---\nWell, if we don\u2019t do what we do then someone else will do it.\n---\nBut yeah, we are the ones making it work.\n---\nSo, I think, looking a little bit towards the future, if you consider the next few years, and for the longer term, perhaps the next fifteen years, what would you say is your vision for what you might call, \u2018Future Food Systems\u2019?\n---\nMy vision for the future \u2013 I think sustainability is the key to anything.\n---\nIf we don\u2019t have sustainability, we\u2019ve got problems.\n---\nI want to bring more farmers on board, to grow our members; to see the benefits of what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nAnd also, to look at taking this \u2013 we\u2019ve just started off a 7.5kg bag line, it\u2019s a new thing for us, getting closer to the customer, and I think we\u2019ll look at something else to get closer to the customer really and cut the factories out, where we become further down the chain.\n---\nThe closer to the customer we get, the more we\u2019ll get back to the farm.\n---\nSo, ultimately you would have a process that would take the produce directly from the farm, straight to the end customer?\n---\nThat is the ultimate.\n---\nI think rather than just selling the potato, we\u2019ll slice it, and things like that.\n---\nOr we\u2019ll put it into ready-made meals.\n---\nWell maybe not that, but get it ready to go closer to the end user.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re sort of gradually, as you mentioned, bypassing elements of the chain, starting recently with going direct to consumer and that\u2019s the direction you want to take in the future?\n---\nI think one thing is the scale, we need to increase the volumes we trade as a group.\n---\nAnd on the other side we need an avenue where we get closer to the customer, to take the volatility out of the job.\n---\nAnd how do you feel this will contribute to sustainability?\nBecause you\u2019ve got [unclear] contracts in front of you.",
                    "contextualized_content": "The organization, referred to as [org name], consists of three farmers who specialize in potato cultivation. They are working collaboratively to centralize the purchasing and marketing of their potatoes, which allows them to streamline operations and reduce reliance on traditional middlemen. By bringing in a trader, they aim to alleviate the burden on individual farms and connect more directly with customers, who prefer dealing with an organization rather than multiple individual farms. This setup not only enhances efficiency but also ensures that profits are returned to the farmers, addressing a significant issue in the agricultural sector where farmers often see little of the profits generated from their produce. The organization operates primarily on a local level but also engages in regional and national supply, and occasionally exports to fill market gaps. Their innovative approach focuses on sustainability and direct sales to consumers, which they believe will further enhance their profitability and stability in the long term."

organisation?\n---\n[org name] , as an organisation, we had contracts \u2013 our customers basically tore up in front of us.\n---\nFor supply, we\u2019ve basically not been able to move the tonnage required because one of our sectors we supply, the food sector, restaurants etc., overnight, stopped.\n---\nAnd I would say about one third of the potato industry supplies this sector.\n---\nSo, all of a sudden, we had a lot of potatoes sat there with no homes.\n---\nThat was a major effect.\n---\nTo the point after the lockdown now, this sector doesn\u2019t require the potatoes.\n---\nAnd we\u2019re planning now for 2021/2022 harvest and to be quite honest we\u2019ve got customers who won\u2019t sign a contract with us until they know more about what is going to happen.\n---\nBut as a farmer, you have to buy the seed, you have to plant the potatoes, you can\u2019t stop.\n---\nBut the customers are just saying, \u2018Well, not sure.\n---\nPlant them \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know later in the year whether we\u2019re going to take them or not.\u2019\n---\nAre you fearing you might end up with a pile of potatoes you can\u2019t sell to anybody?\nAbsolutely.\n---\nThousands of tonnes of potatoes in the ground and in sheds which will not get processed or used.\n---\nThey\u2019ll just get wasted.\n---\nI wonder if the Direct to Customer service could help here?\n---\nIf you could get some straight to the customers, would that help?\n---\nThere is an element of that, but there are a lot of people who don\u2019t use potatoes \u2013 the cooking at home is rice, it\u2019s pasta.\n---\nCertainly, don\u2019t want to be importing stuff, which is what\u2019s coming up.\n---\nSo, if you want to help the British farmers, the supermarkets, the factories need to stop importing stuff.\n---\nAnd start taking things from British suppliers.\n---\nSo, is [org name]  a suitable venue to publicise this, to actually say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve got all this stuff, you don\u2019t need to go abroad\u2019?\n---\nWell, it is, but we\u2019re probably not a big enough player.\n---\nWhen you\u2019re talking to the likes of McCain\u2019s, and Walkers, and those sorts of people, they\u2019re a multinational company anyway, they have suppliers from all over the place.\n---\nIt\u2019s got to come from government level really, to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019\n---\nOr the supermarkets, the customers.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not the public, it is the supermarkets.\n---\nAnd the government has got to say, \u2018No, enough is enough.\u2019\n---\nApart from all these bad things that have clearly happened, is there anything that has changed for the better as a result of COVID?\n---\nAnything at all?\n---\nThe small outlets like farm shops, places like that, they often have online sales, the veg boxes \u2013 that side of things has done very well on the back of it.\n---\nSo, that\u2019s something, that\u2019s good.\n---\nBut it\u2019s not to the same scale as what we\u2019ve lost on the other side.\n---\nAnd I think you\u2019ll be likely to continue building that up, even as COVID passes?\nThat will continue and hopefully will go from strength to strength.\n---\nSo, you\u2019re not going to go quite back to the way you were before?\n---\nIt\u2019s going to be different?\n---\nIt\u2019ll certainly be different.\n---\nYeah, the combination of COVID and Brexit, indeed.\n---\nYeah, it\u2019s killing agriculture big style.\n---\nIf all the manufacturers stop, it\u2019ll kill it.\n---\nAnd that\u2019s all very worrying.\n---\nWell, I hope things get better for you.\n---\nI\u2019ve come to the end of my questions now, you\u2019ve shed a lot of insight into what\u2019s sort of happening in this situation.\n---\nI wonder, do you have any further thoughts, or questions, that you might want to add?\n---\nWhat\u2019s the idea \u2013 obviously you\u2019re asking other people within the industry \u2013 what is the general consensus of what people are saying?\n---\nWe\u2019ve only just started, but one of the aims of the research is to find out just that.\n---\nFind out what are the common issues, what are the common concerns, and what the problems \u2013 and possibly solutions are that people might be facing.\n---\nYeah.\n---\nI think there are two-three solutions to the problem.\n---\nOne, we need to be sourcing more locally and supporting more local businesses \u2013 that\u2019s a must in every sector we go to.\n---\nI think we need to allow the money to come down the food chain, to get it back.\n---\nAnd these food miles are absolutely nuts.\n---\nIt\u2019s mad.\n---\nAnd yeah, money needs to be readily available for people like ourselves to invest in the right places to become more efficient at what we\u2019re doing.\n---\nWe\u2019ll have no business left.\n---\nThe banking industry needs to be relaxed for the right people, to allow them to really put a long-term plan in place for jobs and everything.\n---\nWithout food there isn\u2019t much else, is there really?\nNot really!\n---\nWe\u2019ve got the retail side but that\u2019s upside down.\n---\nBut I\u2019m not saying free money, far from it, I don\u2019t want any subsidies, we\u2019ve got to stand for ourselves.\n---\nWe need to be able survive\n---\nand we need to be competitive.\n---\nSo, what you\u2019re looking for is appropriate investment?\n---\nYes.\n---\nAnd the government-backed loans for the right\u2026it\u2019s like a chicken-and-egg \u2013 you can\u2019t have one without the other, but someone needs to allow us to have some money, an investment pot.\n---\nPut it to them \u2013 to do what you want and what you say you\u2019re going to do, we need these businesses to invest.\n---\nThat seems very clear.\n---\nAs we were saying earlier about if there was more investment in food manufacturing then you could supply those manufacturing firms.\nAbsolutely.\n---\nSo, there needs to be investment down the food chain, but also making those food chains shorter, as short as possible?\n---\nWell, the less people in the chain, there are less people to pay.\n---\nSo, there\u2019s more money coming back to the farm.\n---\nEND",
                    "contextualized_content": "The COVID crisis has had a profound impact on [org name] and the agricultural sector as a whole. With contracts being abruptly canceled, the organization faced a significant challenge in moving the required tonnage of potatoes, particularly as one-third of the potato industry supplies the food sector, which includes restaurants that suddenly ceased operations. This left a surplus of potatoes with no market, leading to concerns about waste and financial losses. As they plan for the upcoming harvest, uncertainty looms as customers hesitate to commit to contracts, creating a precarious situation for farmers who must continue planting without guaranteed sales. \n\nDespite these challenges, there have been some positive developments, such as the growth of small outlets and online sales, which have gained traction during the pandemic. However, the overall landscape remains daunting, with the combination of COVID and Brexit posing significant threats to the agricultural industry. The speaker emphasizes the need for local sourcing and investment to create a more resilient food system, advocating for a reduction in food miles and a more efficient distribution of resources to support farmers and ensure sustainability."
