As we plan for the 2021/2022 harvest, we face a dilemma: many customers are unwilling to sign contracts until they have a clearer understanding of future market conditions. This uncertainty places farmers in a difficult position; we must continue to invest in our operations by purchasing seeds and planting potatoes, even as customers express hesitance about future orders.

This statement underscores the pressing issue of inadequate processing capacity in the UK agricultural sector, which has been exacerbated by recent challenges such as Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. The speaker is concerned that without sufficient processing facilities, the hard work of farmers will not translate into marketable products, leading to waste and financial instability. This reflects a broader call for investment in local processing capabilities to ensure that farmers can effectively bring their produce to market and sustain their livelihoods."

This innovative model not only aims to enhance the financial stability of the farmers but also seeks to create a more sustainable food system. The organization is actively managing the supply of potatoes from multiple farms, ensuring a steady flow to factories and consumers alike. Their recent initiatives, such as launching a direct-to-consumer service, reflect a strategic move towards reducing reliance on larger processing firms and fostering a closer connection with end-users. This approach is particularly relevant in the current climate, where the agricultural sector faces significant challenges, including fluctuating market prices and the impacts of global events like COVID-19 and Brexit."

I know exactly what the issue is and I know where you\u2019d take it forward. But without the investment or money to back what requires doing, it\u2019s a waste of time, isn\u2019t it? So, moving on a little bit more to financial issues, how resilient do you feel your organisation is? How stable do you think things might be, going forward in the next few years? The stability in [org name]  is fine. The stability in agriculture and farming is disastrous. Without the farmers and the potatoes, and supply what ever you\u2019re doing, we\u2019re not very stable. The problem is, manufacturing full stop.",
