Initially we were just growing carrots and parsnips, but we've expanded into leafy greens and specialty herbs.\nSo you've diversified your crop portfolio?\nYes, exactly. The market demand showed us there was a gap for locally-grown herbs, especially for restaurants and specialty markets.\nAnd this is all through the cooperative structure?\nYes, we found that by working together we could better manage distribution and get better prices.

We had to quickly develop a home delivery service.\nHow did you manage that transition?\nIt was challenging. We had to create new packaging solutions, set up an online ordering system for retail customers, and reorganize our delivery routes. But it actually opened up a new market for us.\nWill you continue with direct-to-consumer?\nDefinitely. Even though restaurant business has recovered, we've maintained about 40% of the direct-to-consumer business we developed during COVID. It's become an important part of our model.\nAny other positive changes from COVID?\nIt forced us to become more flexible and resilient. We also developed stronger relationships with our local community. People really appreciated having a reliable local food source during the lockdowns.\nDo you have any final thoughts about the future of local food systems?\nI think we're going to see more hybrid models like ours - combining traditional farming with new technology and direct-to-consumer distribution. The key is maintaining quality and trust while scaling up operations. We need to grow to be sustainable, but not at the expense of our core values.",
