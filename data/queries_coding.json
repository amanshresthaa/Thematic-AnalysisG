        "transcript_chunk": "Can you describe the typical profile of a sex trafficking victim? Victims of sex trafficking often come from vulnerable backgrounds, such as poverty, lack of education, or unstable family situations. They may be lured by promises of a better life, employment opportunities, or even love. Many are young, often under the age of 25, and may have experienced previous trauma or abuse. What are the common tactics used by traffickers? Traffickers use a variety of manipulative tactics, including deception, coercion, and psychological manipulation. They may offer false promises, such as well-paying jobs or romantic relationships, to gain the trust of their victims. Once the victims are isolated and dependent on the traffickers, they use threats, violence, and control to keep them in the trafficking situation. How do you identify potential victims? Identifying potential victims can be challenging, but there are some common signs. Victims may exhibit signs of fear, anxiety, or depression. They may have limited access to personal documents, such as passports or identification cards. They may also show signs of physical abuse or malnutrition. Law enforcement and social workers are trained to recognize these signs and intervene."
