I know exactly what the issue is and I know where you\u2019d take it forward.\" However, they feel limited in their ability to effect change due to a lack of investment, saying, \"without the investment or money to back what requires doing, it\u2019s a waste of time.\" They then discuss the stability of their organization, noting, \"The stability in [org name] is fine,\" but contrasting this with the \"disastrous\" state of agriculture, emphasizing that without farmers and a reliable supply of potatoes, their organization cannot maintain stability. This highlights the critical need for financial support and investment in the agricultural sector to ensure its resilience and sustainability.",

This organization is designed to streamline the process, allowing us to work collectively rather than as isolated entities. So, fundamentally, we brought in a trader to take the burden out of the individual farms and get closer to the customers, because the customers don\u2019t really want to deal with the farms; they would rather go through an organization. This setup acts as an interface between the farmers and the customers, ensuring that the organization is owned by the farmers and tailored to their needs.",
