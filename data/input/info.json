    "theory": "Regulatory Evolution Theory and Market Protection Framework, specifically examining how securities regulation serves as a bridge between traditional financial markets and emerging digital asset systems",
    "philosophical_approach": "Pragmatic enforcement - focusing on how securities laws can accommodate rather than impede technological innovation, evidenced by SEC's approach to 'work with existing securities laws' rather than attempting to create entirely new regulatory frameworks",
    "rationale": "The framework is chosen based on SEC's demonstrated strategy of: 1. Positioning securities laws as an investor protection mechanism rather than an innovation barrier 2. Focusing on solving specific regulatory problems (disclosure, fraud prevention) rather than pursuing broader technological endorsement 3. Emphasizing compliance and investor protection as key drivers of digital asset integration into traditional finance"
