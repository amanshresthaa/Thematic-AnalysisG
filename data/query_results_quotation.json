Initially we were just growing carrots and parsnips, but we've expanded into leafy greens and specialty herbs.\nSo you've diversified your crop portfolio?\nYes, exactly. The market demand showed us there was a gap for locally-grown herbs, especially for restaurants and specialty markets.\nAnd this is all through the cooperative structure?\nYes, we found that by working together we could better manage distribution and get better prices.

We've tried to build resilience by diversifying both our crops and our customer base.\nWhat about investment needs?\nThat's our biggest challenge. The vertical farming expansion we want to do requires significant capital investment. Traditional banks don't always understand our model.\nDo you have contingency plans?\nYes, we maintain cash reserves for weather-related emergencies, and we're developing partnerships with other cooperatives so we can help each other if needed. The diversity of our member farms also helps spread risk.",
