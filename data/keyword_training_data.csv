    Content: When you say that, do you mean the farm side or the [org name]? I think the [org name]. [org name] is 3 farmers, we all grow potatoes. We are all selling individually, and what we’re trying to do is come together to make an organisation basically, where all our potatoes are bought centrally and marketed all together. This organization is designed to streamline the process, allowing us to work collectively rather than as isolated entities. So, fundamentally, we brought in a trader to take the burden out of the individual farms and get closer to the customers, because the customers don’t really want to deal with the farms; they would rather go through an organization. This setup acts as an interface between the farmers and the customers, ensuring that the organization is owned by the farmers and tailored to their needs.

    Content: Initially, we had to go through other channels outside of [org name], which meant a significant portion of the profits was absorbed by the middleman. Our primary goal is to eliminate this intermediary, ensuring that all the money that would typically go to them is redirected back to the farmers. We are not focused on generating profit for ourselves; instead, our mission is to ensure that the financial benefits are passed directly to the farmers. This is a fundamental issue in the agricultural industry—money is not reaching the farmers as it should. The lack of financial return to farmers is a critical problem we aim to address through our organization.

    Content: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on [org name], as highlighted by the sudden disruption of contracts with customers. With the food sector, particularly restaurants, ceasing operations overnight, the organization found itself unable to move the required tonnage of potatoes. This situation left a significant amount of produce without a market, illustrating the precarious nature of the agricultural supply chain. The speaker notes that approximately one third of the potato industry is dependent on this sector, underscoring the scale of the challenge faced by [org name] and the urgency to adapt to these unforeseen circumstances.

    Content: The speaker envisions a future where sustainability is paramount in the food system. They aim to expand their organization by bringing more farmers on board, thereby increasing the collective benefits for all members. A key initiative is the introduction of a 7.5kg bag line, which represents a step towards getting closer to the customer and reducing dependency on factories. This approach is intended to create a more direct supply chain, ultimately allowing for a process that delivers produce straight from the farm to the end customer. By doing so, they hope to enhance profitability for farmers and ensure that the financial benefits of their work are maximized.

    Content: In terms of collaborators, the organization currently works with three direct farms that supply potatoes, along with other contractual farms that guarantee their produce to the group. This collaborative network is essential for maintaining a consistent supply of potatoes to major factories such as Walkers, McCains, and Seabrooks, as well as providing pre-packaged products for supermarkets like Morrison’s. The organization’s role is to bypass the traditional middle man, ensuring that the profits from sales are directed back to the farmers, thereby supporting their livelihoods and promoting a more sustainable agricultural model.
